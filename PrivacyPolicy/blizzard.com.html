                    <li>To play Games on the Platform, you will need to add a Game license to an Account, which
                        requires an authentication code generated by Blizzard. For Game licenses purchased at retail,
                        the
                        authentication code will either be included in the packaging materials or sent to you via
                        electronic
                        means. If you purchase a Game digitally from Blizzard, the authentication code will be assigned

                        the Account when you purchase the Game.

                            href="http://us.battle.net/en/security/">here</a>. You must maintain the confidentiality of
                        the
                        Login Information, as you are responsible for all uses of the Login Information and the Account,
                        including purchases, whether or not authorized by you. If you become aware of or reasonably
                        suspect
                        any breach of security, including without limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure
                        of
                        the Login Information, you must immediately notify Blizzard at <a

                        legal ward (collectively, your “Child”) to use an Account on the Platform, you hereby agree to

                        responsible for all uses of the Account by your Child whether or not such uses were authorized
                        by

                        Code of Conduct (the “Code of Conduct”) and applicable in-game policies (the “In-game
                        Policies”).
                        The Code of Conduct and In-Game Policies are not meant to be exhaustive. The Code of Conduct and
                        In-Game Policies are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference, and are available on
                        Blizzard’s Customer Support database, located at: https://us.battle.net/support/en/.

                    <li>You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using your Account. If
                        you choose a recurring subscription for a Game, you acknowledge that payments will be processed
                        automatically (e.g., debited from your Blizzard Balance or charged to your credit card) until
                        you
                        cancel the subscription or the Account. Blizzard may revise the pricing for the goods and
                        services
                        offered through the Platform at any time. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BLIZZARD IS NOT REQUIRED TO

                        PLATFORM, FOR ANY REASON.
                    </li>

                        (c)
                        to protect Blizzard’s legal rights and remedies; (d) to protect the health or safety of anyone
                        that
                        Blizzard believes may be threatened; or (e) to report a crime or other offensive behavior.

        to the Game, that the physical media on which the Game was distributed, if any, shall be free from
        defects in material and workmanship. In the event that such media proves to be defective during that
        time period, and upon presentation to Blizzard of proof of purchase of the defective media, Blizzard
        will at its option: (a) correct any defect, (b) provide you with a similar product of similar value,

        <p>If you are a resident of Australia, the benefits provided to you by this Limited Warranty are in addition to
            other rights or remedies you may have under local laws related to the goods to which the warranty applies. Our
            goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a
            replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage.
            You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and
            the failure does not amount to a major failure. The provisions of this clause containing the Limited Warranty
            and the clause containing the Limitation of Liability and Indemnity below apply only to the extent permitted by
            the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). The entitlement to a replacement or a refund for a major failure is
            not subject to Blizzard’s option. To submit a warranty claim to Blizzard, please call 1800 041 378 or send to PO

        Blizzard during the six (6) months prior to your making a claim against Blizzard. Because some jurisdictions

                foregoing events occur, as long as you continue using the Platform. In the event that Blizzard
                chooses to cease providing the Platform, or license to a third party the right to provide the
                Platform, Blizzard shall provide you with no less than three (3) months prior notice. Neither the
                Platform nor Blizzard’s agreement to provide access to the Platform shall be considered a rental or

                        most Account suspensions and terminations are the result of violations of this Agreement. In
                        case of minor violations of these rules, Blizzard may provide you with a prior warning
                        and/or suspend your use of the Account due to your non-compliance prior to terminating the
