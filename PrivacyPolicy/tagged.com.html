Purchases or other acquisitions of Gold provide only a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, fully-revocable license to use such Gold to access Services that <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref">34</a></sup> we expressly make available for use with such Gold for your personal non-commercial use. Gold is redeemable only on the Tagged site for Tagged digital merchandise and content. Gold does not expire. Gold is non-refundable. <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref">35</a></sup> Gold has no monetary value and does not constitute currency or property of any type.

<p>You may use Gold to purchase Gifts for other users. The price for each Gift will be displayed at the point of purchase. Gifts constitute a limited license to access a certain feature on the Tagged platform when, as, and if allowed by Tagged. All sales of Gifts are final and Tagged does not offer refunds for any purchased Gifts. Tagged is not responsible for repairing or replacing Gifts, or providing you with any credit or refund in the event that Tagged modifies, suspends, or terminates the Gift program, or for loss or damage due to any service error, or any other reason.</p>

<p>Gifts purchased or received by any user do not constitute property and are not transferable.</p>

<h3 id="I">I) Stars and Cash Out</h3>

<p>Each user who receives a Gift from another user during a video broadcast will get a number of Stars as determined by Company. By the end of 2017, Company intends to offer a cash-out option with respect to Stars. When Company enables said feature, users will be able to redeem Stars for cash, provided that a user must cash out at least two hundred dollars ($200) worth of Stars for each request, and may cash out only once per day. Company may change the cash-out minimum increments and frequency from time to time, and it reserves the right to do so. Company will also determine the rate of redemption in its sole discretion and it may change the rate from time to time.  The rate will be displayed at the point of redemption. You agree that Company has the absolute right to manage, modify, and/or eliminate such redemption feature in its sole discretion. The cost of the Gifts that you give to another user may not correlate to the revenue such user is entitled to receive from Company.</p>

<p>Company intends to use a third-party vendor (Tipalti, Inc.) for cash redemption, and users wishing to redeem Stars for cash must 1) have a valid PayPal account, 2) must agree to said vendor’s terms of service, as well as its policies and procedures, and 3) bear any charges that said vendor may impose.  User understands that all information submitted during the cash out process will be stored by vendor on vendor’s servers, and will not be under the control of Company. User understands that Company has no control over our third-party vendor’s practices and user releases Company from any and all liability associated with information submitted to Company’s third party vendor, including, without limitation, liability related to the unauthorized release or use of user’s information. Company reserves the right to verify your identity and eligibility to receive cash redemptions prior to payment.</p>

<p>All Stars in your account are forfeited if you delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason.</p>

<p>All users who redeem Stars are solely responsible for the reporting and payment of any taxes due on the amounts redeemed.</p>

<h3 id="J">J) VIP Membership</h3>

<p><sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref">37</a></sup> You may decide to upgrade your membership to VIP status for an additional monthly cost.

    <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<p>Updated as of July 12, 2017</p>

<h3 id="how_tagged_works">How Our Service Works</h3>

<p><sup id="fnref:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> The Meet Group, Inc. (“we” “us” “our” or “Company”) is dedicated to respecting the privacy of its visitors, customers, and users (“Users”) of Tagged, as well as other Company brands, products and services (the “Services”). When you visit and interact with the Services you may provide information about yourself or your opinions, and it is wise and prudent to be aware of the personal information that you are sharing. <sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> We understand this and we have established this Privacy Policy (“Policy) to explain how we collect information from you and how this information is used. We have created side summaries to help you easily locate specific terms within this policy. <sup id="fnref:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> These summaries are for reference only and in the event that there is a discrepancy between this Privacy Policy and the language of the side summaries, the Privacy Policy will prevail.</p>

<h3 id="who_is_eligible">Who is Eligible to Use the Services</h3>

<p>To use the Services, you must be 18 years of age or older.  If you are under age 18, you may only use the Services with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian. By registering on the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any local, state or federal government entity. No User may participate where doing so would be prohibited by any applicable law or regulation.</p>

<h3 id="children_and_safety">Children and Safety</h3>

<p><sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> The Services are a general audience website for Users who are 18 years of age or older. The safety and privacy of children is extremely important to the Company and we use the safeguards described below to protect children.</p>

<p><sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup>  Our registration process is designed to restrict children under age 18 from becoming Users of the Services without the involvement of a parent or legal guardian, through use of an age gate mechanism on the registration page.  If we receive information suggesting that a User of one of our Sites is under age 18, we require the User to provide evidence, the nature of which is determined by the Company, confirming that the User is at least 18 years old, and we reserve the right to suspend the User’s account while we review the evidence and verify the User’s age. If the User fails to provide such evidence within 48 hours, we may terminate the User's account and delete all personal information displaying on the Services.</p>

<p>For more information about protecting your privacy, please visit the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission’s web site</a>. In addition to the previously mentioned safeguards for the detection and removal of Members under the age of 18, we have a process for parents to contact the Company directly so that we can take the proper steps required to be in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). <sup id="fnref:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup></p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service. <sup id="fnref:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup> The Services and its content are not directed at children under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at Member Services, The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, submit your request here, or email support@themeetgroup.com.</p>

<p>Parents: If your child is under the age of 13 and has joined the Services using a false age, please notify us at parentcare@tagged.com, and we will terminate your child's account and delete all personal information displaying on the Services. If you would like to know more about our site, stored information about your child, or how to terminate your child's account, please send your request by mail to Member Services, The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, submit your request here, or email support@themeetgroup.com..

<h3 id="tagged_use_of_information">The Company’s Use of Your Information</h3>

<p><sup id="fnref:111"><a href="#fn:111" class="footnote-ref">10</a></sup> The Company uses certain of your personal information to enable you to interact, or to enhance your experience, with the Services and their features.
