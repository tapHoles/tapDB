                        <p>Additionally, the Platforms may use GPS (global positioning systems) software and other location-based technologies such as "iBeacons" to locate you so we may verify your location, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as allow you to share your location to other users as part of the services we provide via the Platform.  We may determine your approximate and/or exact location information to provide location-based services.  In addition to traditional GPS location-based services, some of the retailers and others we work with may install other types of location-tracking technology. These technologies emit a signal that we can use to detect to pinpoint your proximity to those locations (such as how close you are to retail locations and products) or otherwise interact with the Platform (such as to send you helpful information, offers, and discounts).</p>

For example, if you click on an advertisement that led you to one of our Platforms, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement; or, you may be served AG advertisements elsewhere online based on your visit to or use of the Platforms. Some of these third parties may collect Personal Information when you visit the Platforms or other websites or online services.

                <p>For example, Social Features may enable you to indicate through a third party website or interactive service that you "like" a Platform or content available on a Platform, or to "share" content from the Platforms. Social Features may also allow you to upload or download photos to or from your account on a third party website or interactive service, or to login to one or more of the Platforms using your access credentials for a third party website or interactive service. If you upload photos directly from a third party website or interactive service, AG will use those photos only in connection with your relationship with us and will not make those photos publicly available (unless you choose to make those photos publicly available).</p>
                <p>If you choose to use Social Features, certain information, which may include your Personal Information, may be publicly displayed, and the third party website or interactive service used in connection with the Social Features (and its users) may have access to information about you and your use of our Platforms. Similarly, if you post information on a third party website or interactive service that references the Platforms (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with the Platforms in a tweet or status update), your post may be published on the Platforms in accordance with the terms of the third party website or interactive service, and we may collect the information in your post.</p>
                <p>We may receive information about you from third party providers of Social Features that interact with our Platforms. For example, if you choose to use Social Features, you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information, related to your use of the third party website or interactive service. The third party website or interactive service may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or service, but we may retain the information previously collected in accordance with respective third-party privacy policies.  In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website, feature or application give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your posts, your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page on a third party social media website, feature or application. The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Notice.

                <h3>California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
                <p>California Civil Code section 1798.83 permits California residents to request from AG certain information regarding the disclosure of certain categories of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes within the immediately preceding calendar year. A company may also comply with the law by disclosing in its privacy notice that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes (as AG does), and information on how to exercise that choice.</p>

                <p>If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to the following email address: <a href="mailto:help@americangreetings.com">help@americangreetings.com</a> or write to us at the following mailing address: AmericanGreetings.com, One American Boulevard, Cleveland, OH 44145. You must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of your e-mail or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.</p>

                <p>If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any Platform, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content that you have publicly posted.  To make such a request, please send an e-mail with a detailed description of the specific content to <a href="mailto:help@americangreetings.com">help@americangreetings.com</a>.
