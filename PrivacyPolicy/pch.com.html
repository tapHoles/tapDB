    <strong id="personalinfo">1. Why does PCH collect personal information?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We need to collect certain personal information from our visitors to
    process and fulfill online sweepstakes entries and online orders for the
    products and services we offer. For example, we need your full name, e-mail
    address and date of birth to verify eligibility and enter you in the
    sweepstakes, notify you if you've won a prize, to process any redemption
    activity and to fulfill any magazine subscription or product you may
    purchase. We may also use the personal data we collect for systems
    administration and troubleshooting purposes, to report aggregate
    information to our marketing partners and others and to help provide you
    more relevant and enjoyable visits to our site.
</p>
<p>
    Why does PCH collect information from a user's device? We need to collect
    certain device information so that we may ensure that you are being served
    the correct version of the app, so we are able to notify you that you have
    won a contest, so that we may determine which user has downloaded the
    application, users are then given a chance to win contests. We will collect
    the following information from a user's device Android Device ID, Operating
    System Version, Flash Version, Browser Type, Service Provider, Mobile
    Device Model, Screen Resolution, Language, Country, City, and Mobile input
    selector (touch screen, etc.)
</p>
<p>
    To provide our users with a more personalized and relevant web service, we
    may also collect and use personal data to identify users' specific
    interests and needs. If given permission, we may notify our users online or
    via email of offers and information we feel may be of interest to them
    available from PCH. Our online registration and entry page contains a
    clearly identified checked box indicating that by submitting the form you
    wish to receive offers from PCH. Users may unsubscribe from such offers by
    clicking to remove the check in the permission notice box before submitting
    the registration and entry form.
</p>
<p>
    We may share our unsubscribe list with select marketing partners for the
    sole purpose of insuring that individuals on this list do not receive
    electronic commercial mail messages containing Publishers Clearing House
    promotions and advertisements that may be sent by such partners. We collect
    personally identifiable information to allow our affiliates, our technical
    consultants, auditors and other third parties who work with us to make our
    sites and services available, enhance their functionality, or provide
    associated services to you such as delivering content, samples, products,
    and gifts and prizes. We may use your personally identifiable information
    to exchange, link or combine it with third party data groups to help better
    understand your needs and provide you with enhanced and more relevant
    service. Your personal information may be used to send you technical
    notices, updates, security alerts, support information and administrative
    messages.
</p>
<p>
    We send entrants a confirmation e-mail when they register for our
    sweepstakes or complete other transactions at our site. These confirmation
    e-mails are not promotional in nature and the user may not opt-out of
    receiving these transactional e-mails. If you are currently receiving
    commercial e-mail messages from Publishers Clearing House after previously
    providing permission and no longer wish to receive such offers you may
    unsubscribe at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link or the "EZ
    Unsubscribe" seal in any commercial e-mail from PCH. You may also contact
    PCH either through our "Ask Us" page in the Info Center section of PCH or
    by writing directly to Christopher L. Irving,, Consumer &amp; Privacy
    Affairs, PCH, 300 Jericho Quadrangle #300 Jericho, NY 11753. We may
    send our PCH mobile application users push notifications, to inform them of
    new drawings and alert them of third party offers that may be of interest
    to them. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications,
    you may do so by turning this feature off at the device level.
</p>
<p>
    We collect your location based information for the purpose of locating a
    place that you may be searching for in your area or alerting you to a
    special event in your area. We will only share this information with our
    mapping provider for the sole purpose of providing you the service. If you
    no longer wish to allow us to use this information you may turn it off at
    the device level.

<p>
    When you order gift subscriptions on our site, we will ask you for your
    friend or family's contact information including name, mailing address and
    e-mail address. We will use this information only for the purpose that it
    was collected (i.e. to fulfill the gift subscription).
</p>
<p>
    When you utilize the share feature located within our mobile application we
    will ask for your friend's email address. We will use this information to
    send them a one-time email inviting them to visit and download the
    application.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="gather">2. How and what information does PCH gather or track?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We collect personal data from our users mainly during the initial
    registration process for sweepstakes entry and order processing. Although
    some of the personal identifying information is necessary to deliver these
    services (e.g., an address is required to buy goods and services from PCH),
    in some cases the information is optional and in these instances users can
    determine what information they wish to submit. In addition some properties
    have an initial registration process and we may, from time to time, ask
    users to answer optional questions about products and services. We gather
    this data in order to better understand our users' interests and provide
    them with relevant offers and information.
</p>
<p>
    Through the use of "cookies" "pixel tags" "flash cookies" (described below)
    and online survey and registration forms, we may collect personal data on,
    among other things, the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Demographic: age, gender, income level</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Technical: IP address, domain name, e-mail address, site traffic
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Reference: name and address, telephone number, password
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The website that referred you to us.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The web pages you viewed on our site</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            The advertisements you viewed and clicked on at our site.
        </strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    PCH collects certain personal information from our visitors to process and
    fulfill online entries for PCH drawings and to provide tokens and other
    gameplay rewards. For example, we need your full name, postal and email
    address to enter you in the PCH drawings, confirm your entry, contact you
    if you have won and notify you about any updates or changes to our site. If
    you create a profile you may have the ability to upload photos and create a
    tag line that can be shared with friends or the public. You get a friend
    when you click another user's avatar. This takes you to that user's page
    where you can click the "Add as a Friend" button. If you choose to use our
    referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your
    friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a
    one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. PCH does not store
    this information and uses it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time
    email and tracking the success of our referral program.
</p>
<p>
    When you access PCH offered applications at social media sites like
    Facebook you allow us to access certain information from your profile at
    those sites. For example, when you access a game or application using the
    Facebook Platform, Facebook will usually provide the application your User
    ID, as well your friends' User IDs (or your friend list). The information
    you allow us to access is affected by the privacy settings you have
    established at the social media site. You can control and find out more
    about these settings at Facebook at.

    <strong id="cookies">3. What are Cookies and other tracking technologies?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers,
    use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze
    trends, administer the digital property, tracking users' movements around
    the digital property, and to gather demographic information about our user

    "Pixel tracking", a common process which may be used in connection with
    advertisements on other sites, involves the use of pixel tags that are not
    visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer
    coding. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of these advertisements
    and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an
    invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites you may visit and is used
    to track an individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to
    identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our
    offers with your interests. For example, if you visit our Web site from an
    advertisement on another site, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to
    track that their advertisement brought you to the PCH site. If you visit
    our website and we link you to another site we may also be able to
    determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third party web
    site. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research.
    Personal information about you is not collected by the third party
    advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the
    pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to
    report web site activity to us.

    We and third party partners use local shared objects, such as Flash
    cookies, and Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store your preferences such
    as volume control or high game score, or display content and/or display
    advertising based upon your Web browsing activity to personalize your

    As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically
    and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP)
    addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
    pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
    information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends,
    to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to
    gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not
    link this automatically-collected data to personal information. Some of our
    business partners (e.g., tracking utility company) use cookies on our site.
    We have no access to or control over these cookies.
</p>
<p>
    We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the
    functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may
    record information such as how often you use the application, the events
    that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and
    where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information
    we store within the analytics software to any personal information you
    submit within the mobile application.

    <strong id="disclosure">4. Does PCH disclose user information to third parties?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Except as otherwise noted in this policy, PCH only discloses user
    information in aggregate form to marketing partners. For example, we might
    tell a marketing partner how many users visited PCH over a period of time,
    but we will never tell them who it was that saw or clicked on their offer,
    unless that user has provided permission to do so.
</p>
<p>
    We share our users Android ID with application tracking companies so that
    we can track whether a user has downloaded one of our Customer's
    applications. We will share our unique ID for the user with our customer's
    so that we are able to provide users with their prizes.
</p>
<p>
    PCH believes that consumers should be able to control the use of their
    data. Users always have the option whether to engage in offers presented on
    PCH. In addition, the personal information our users provide to us may be
    combined with other personal information (such as demographic information
    and past purchase information) available from our records and other
    sources. We use a third party to verify your address, in order to process
    your order prior to shipping. This allows us and, with permission, to
    present our users with offers and information geared towards their
    interests. PCH is not and cannot be responsible for the activities or
    privacy policies of these third parties.
</p>
<p>
   Our applications may contains tools from third party service providers that may 
   enable these third parties to separately collect and/or analyze non-personally 
   identifiable information from the Users' devices in accordance with such third parties' 
   own privacy policies and subject to their own applicable legal requirements; and (b) 
   it is highly recommended that Users regularly review such third parties' privacy policies.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a merger, acquisition, or change of control of PCH,
    customer data would be considered a business asset and would be
    transferred. We will disclose information we maintain when required to do
    so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may
    also disclose personal information as required by law or to protect the
    safety and security of our users.
</p>
<p>
    You should also know that when you order a magazine subscription from PCH,
    we need to provide your name and address to the magazine publisher so they
    can start your service. Publishers may exchange or rent their subscriber
    names, typically to third party companies that match reader interests. If
    you do not wish to receive such offers, we suggest that you notify the
    publisher directly (the contact information is usually found in each
    magazine issue).
</p>
<p>
    We use other third parties vendors such as credit card processors and
    e-mail service providers to provide order fulfillment and e-mail delivery
    services on our site. When you register on our site, we will share your
    personal information as necessary for these third parties to provide these
    services. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal
    information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes
    and we maintain strict security measures and monitoring with such vendors
to insure consumer information is safe. When you register with    <a href="http://pch.com/" target="_blank">pch.com</a> we may share your name and
    information with third parties who may contact you by mail with relevant
offers. If you wish to opt out of such exchanges you may    <a href="http://svc.pch.com/PrismOptout/GenericOptout.aspx" target="_blank">click here</a>.
    We may share your personally identifiable information with our affiliates,
    our technical consultants, auditors and other third parties who work with
    us to make our sites and services available, enhance their functionality,
    or provide associated services such as delivering you content, samples,
    products, and gifts and prizes. We may also use your personally
    identifiable information to exchange, link or combine it with third party
    data groups to help understand your needs and provide you with better and
    more relevant service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Targeted or Behavioral Advertising:</strong>
    Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses
    information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the
    pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is
    then used to select which PCH advertisement should be displayed to a
    particular individual on websites other than PCH. For example, if you have
    shown a preference for cooking while visiting PCH, you may be served an
    advertisement from PCH for cooking related products when you visit a site
    other than PCH. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous
    cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that
    could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or
    credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either
    comes from PCH or through third party website publishers. We may use your
    personal data to serve you relevant ads based upon your interests through
    our own and select third party ad partners. In such cases, PCH will provide
    your personal data such as encrypted email address and mobile advertising
    identifier to such third party service providers so that we may serve you
    with ads that may be of interest to you. If you would like to opt out of
    targeted advertising from PCH that occurs when visiting our third party
    advertising publishers, please
    <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=pch01" target="_blank">
        click here
    </a>
    : If you are accessing our promotions and content through our mobile apps,
    you may opt out of such targeted advertising by opening the menu options on
    our APP, clicking on ‚ÄúAd Preferences‚Äù and completing your opt out
    preferences as indicated. Please note that this will opt you out of
    targeted ads from PCH and any other participating advertisers. If you opt
    out, you will continue to receive online advertising from Publishers
    Clearing House; however, these ads may not be as relevant to you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="optout">
        5. Can I opt-out of PCH's data collection and/or distribution?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Receiving email messages from PCH, our affiliates and partners is optional.
    As noted earlier, the collection, use, and distribution of personal data
    helps us create a more personalized, relevant, and intelligent web service
    for our users. While some basic data is necessary to provide certain
    services, such as entry into the sweepstakes and fulfillment of products
    and services ordered through PCH, there are some cases where the submission
    of information is optional.
</p>
<p>
    If you are already receiving PCH promotional emails and no longer wish to
    receive such communications, simply follow the "unsubscribe" instructions
    that appear in every PCH e-mail, or contact us through our "Ask Us" page
    found in our Info Center section or by writing directly to Christopher L.
    Irving, Consumer &amp; Privacy Affairs, PCH, 382 Channel Drive, Port
    Washington, New York, 11050. As soon as we receive your request our systems
    will process your removal at once and in all cases within the required time
    frame required by federal law.
</p>
<p>
    If you have provided personal information directly to our third party
    marketing partners and are receiving email communications directly from
    these third parties PCH cannot, in most instances, unsubscribe users from
    these third parties. If you wish to unsubscribe from one of our marketing
    partner's e-mail programs, please follow their unsubscribe procedures which
    will be found within their e-mails or in their privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="external">6. What about external web sites?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To the extent hyperlinks or banner advertisements incorporating hyperlinks
    are utilized on this Site to access third party sites, users should be
    aware that these third party web sites are not controlled by PCH and,
    therefore, are not subject to this privacy policy. We recommend that users
    check the privacy policies of these individual sites to see how their
    personal information will be utilized.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that our Web sites utilize framing techniques to make it appear
    that the user is still on the site when the user is actually on a third
    party Web site. For example, if you are on a page that has the look and
    feel of www.PCH, but the url listed in your browser is a different url than
    www.PCH, then know that the information is being collected by this third
    party and their privacy policy governs the collection and use of this
    information.

        7. Does PCH allow users access to their information for review and
        updating?

    <strong id="secure">8. What does PCH do to keep their site secure?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We have implemented a number of security features throughout the PCH
    properties that are intended to prevent the unauthorized release of or
    access to the user information we collect online. For example, database
    information is firewall protected. Also, only authorized PCH personnel have
    access to any stored personal information we collect from our users.
    Moreover, password and credit card information you submit to PCH is always
    encrypted during transmission. Users should be aware that e-mail is not
    encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card
    numbers.
</p>
<p>
    While we strive to create a secure and reliable site for our users, the
    confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted over the
    Internet cannot be 100% guaranteed. Users should keep in mind that any
    information submitted through an Internet transaction is potentially
    accessible to the public, and consequently, can be collected and used by
    others without their consent. PCH is not responsible or liable for illegal
    interception of personal data via any Internet transaction. When we collect
    and transmit sensitive data such as your credit card number, we encrypt it
    using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

        9. Does PCH collect information from users outside of the United
        States?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The PCH site is not directed to visitors residing outside of the United
    States and such users are not eligible to submit online sweepstakes
    entries. However, as indicated in the Official Rules on the site, some
    sweepstakes promoted on the PCH Site are open to residents of the U.K. and
    Canada. Residents from these countries can participate in these sweepstakes
    by sending a write-in entry to the address provided in the Official Rules.
    We regret that as a result of system limitations at this time non-U.S.
    residents may not order products through PCH. If PCH becomes aware that a
    user who does not reside in the United States has registered with the PCH
    site, PCH will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from its
    files.
</p>
<p>
    <strong id="children">10. Does PCH collect personal information from children?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The PCH site is not targeted nor directed to children under the age of
    thirteen. PCH does not intend to collect personal information from
    individuals in this age group. If PCH receives actual notice that a child
    under the age of thirteen has provided personal information to PCH, PCH
    will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from its files.
