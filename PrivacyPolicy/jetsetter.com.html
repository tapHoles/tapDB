<p><strong>Display of advertising/your choices</strong></p>
<p><em>Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising</em></p>
<p>Jetsetter and its affiliated websites are committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites. To do this, we may collect information about your travel-related searches and other site activities, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or elsewhere online that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on Jetsetter, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on Jetsetter or on another website you visit.</p>
<p><em>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising</em></p>
<p>On our Site, we may collect information about your online activities to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. You may see certain ads on this and other sites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral, and contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons, and other methods. The networks use this information to show you advertisements for Jetsetter and our business partners that are tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors’ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed, and the actions you take on the sites. This data collection and ad targeting take place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>
<p>To direct our ad network vendors not to use your data to deliver targeted advertising to you, please contact us at privacy@jetsetter.com.</p>
<p><em>Response to Do Not Track signals</em></p>
<p>Your web browser may transmit a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal to Jetsetter and other websites. Because of differences in web browsers’ default settings and the manner in which browsers incorporate DNT signals, it is sometimes unclear to site operators whether site visitors have selected the DNT setting themselves, or whether they are aware that they have a choice in determining the setting. Jetsetter does not currently respond to DNT signals. Once the Internet industry has settled on standards related to this issue and Jetsetter recognizes such standards, we may reevaluate this approach.</p>

By visiting the Site, [www.jetsetter.com](http:\/\/www.jetsetter.com\/) or other Jetsetter branded domains, or using a Jetsetter application (an \u201cApplication\u201d or \u201cApp\u201d) on a mobile phone, tablet, or similar device (a \u201cDevice\u201d) or in connection with other sites or services, you are accepting the practices described herein. The phrase \u201cpersonal information\u201d refers to information by which you or the device you are using to connect to the Internet can be identified.\n\n### **What information we collect from you**\n\n**In general.**\n\nWe may obtain personal information about you from various sources, including your use of the Site and\/or App; your communication with us through phone, email, or social media; your participation in events, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions; and your use of Wanderlist or other features on the Site. We also may obtain information about you from our parent, affiliate, or subsidiary companies; business partners; and other third parties.\n\nThe types of personal information we may obtain include, but is not limited to:\n\n- Your contact information (including, but not limited to, first and last name, Twitter handle, postal and email address, and\/or phone number)\n- Contact information of friends or other people you would like us to contact\n- Username and password for the account you may establish on our sites\n- Username and any other information on your Jetsetter profile or any other profile or account you create on the Site\n- Payment details (including payment card number, security code, expiration date, cardholder name and billing address)\n- Shipping information (including the shipping address and phone number)\n- Demographic information (such as age, date of birth and gender)\n- Information you provide by interacting with us through social media, including photographs\n- Location information, such as the real-time geographic location of the device on which you install our mobile application(s)\n- Shopping behavior and preferences, and a record of the purchases you make on our Site\n- Photos, text, or any other content you post on the Site\n- Information about your travel preferences and\/or plans\n- Any publicly available information you choose to share on the Site\n- Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us by third parties\n\n**Automatic information.**\n\nWe automatically collect some information from your computer or Device when you visit the Site. For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed, pages visited, and searches and\/or reservations facilitated or made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests and preferences of our users and customize your user experience.\n\n**Payment information.**\n\nIf you make travel reservations with third-party suppliers facilitated by Jetsetter, we will collect payment information from you, including your credit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, authentication code, and billing address. We will securely transmit this information to the supplier of the travel reservation to complete the transaction. Please note that, in some cases, the supplier processes your payment, not Jetsetter, unless otherwise specified. You agree to review and be bound by the supplier\u2019s policies and procedures before making a reservation through Jetsetter.\n\n**Location Information and Other Information from Devices.**\n\nWhen you use an Application on a Device, we will collect and use information about you in generally similar ways and for similar purposes as when you use the Site. In addition, we may collect information about your location if you have instructed your Device to send such information to the Application via the privacy settings on that Device, or if you have uploaded photos tagged with location information. We may use the location information collected from your Device or photos to enhance your use of the Application by providing you with relevant content and contextual advertising. For example, we may use your location to show you information about hotels or restaurants near you when you are traveling. You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any time, in order to turn off the functionality to share location information with the Application and\/or the functionality to tag your photos with location information. Please note that turning off location sharing may affect certain features of our App. If you have any queries about the privacy settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Device or your mobile service provider for help.\n\n**Cookies and other web technologies.**\n\nIn addition, when you use the Site, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. A \u201ccookie\u201d is a text file that websites send to a visitor\u2019s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor\u2019s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A \u201cweb beacon,\u201d also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server. We also may use third-party website analytics tools (such as Omniture), that collect information about visitor traffic on our sites and mobile applications.\n\nThe information we may collect by automated means includes:\n\n- Information about the devices our visitors use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser, and operating system type)\n- URLs that refer visitors to our sites\n- Dates and times of visits to our sites\n- Information on actions taken on our sites (such as page views and site navigation patterns)\n- Geographic location (such as country and city) from which a visitor accesses our Site\n- Search terms that visitors use to reach our sites\n\nWe may use cookies for the following general purposes:\n\n- To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our Site. For example, if you register on the Site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our Site each time you visit. Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.\n- To help us customize the content, experience, and advertisements provided to you on our Site and App and on other websites across the Internet. For example, when you access a web page, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests. See Display of Advertising\/Your Choices for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.\n- To help measure and research the effectiveness of features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and\/or act upon).\n-   This Site participates in exchanges of anonymous information about user browsing behavior on the Site. This non-personally identifiable information is collected by cookies and other similar technologies and segmented into different anonymized groups. We may share these types of anonymous information with third parties to facilitate the display of targeted advertisements. Please click [here](http:\/\/optout.networkadvertising.org\/#!\/) or [here](http:\/\/optout.aboutads.info\/#!\/) to learn more about these types of exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies and your options with regard to participation in these programs (including opting-out).  \n\n**Display of advertising\/your choices**\n\n_Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising_\n\nJetsetter and its affiliated websites are committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites. To do this, we may collect information about your travel-related searches and other site activities, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or elsewhere online that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on Jetsetter, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on Jetsetter or on another website you visit.\n\n_Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising_\n\nOn our Site, we may collect information about your online activities to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. You may see certain ads on this and other sites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral, and contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons, and other methods. The networks use this information to show you advertisements for Jetsetter and our business partners that are tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors\u2019 advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed, and the actions you take on the sites. This data collection and ad targeting take place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\n\nTo direct our ad network vendors not to use your data to deliver targeted advertising to you, please contact us at privacy@jetsetter.com.\n\n_Response to Do Not Track signals_\n\nYour web browser may transmit a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (\u201cDNT\u201d) signal to Jetsetter and other websites. Because of differences in web browsers\u2019 default settings and the manner in which browsers incorporate DNT signals, it is sometimes unclear to site operators whether site visitors have selected the DNT setting themselves, or whether they are aware that they have a choice in determining the setting. Jetsetter does not currently respond to DNT signals. Once the Internet industry has settled on standards related to this issue and Jetsetter recognizes such standards, we may reevaluate this approach.\n\n**How we use your information**\n\nWe may use the information we obtain about you to:\n\n- Register you for membership on our Site, and manage and maintain your account on the sites, including to allow your access to and use of the Site\n- Provide products or services you request\n- Process, validate, confirm, verify, deliver, and track your purchases (including by processing payment card transactions, arranging shipping and handling returns and refunds, and contacting you about your orders, including by telephone)\n- Maintain a record of the purchases you make on our sites\n- Respond to your questions and comments and provide customer support\n- Communicate with you about our products, services, offers, events and promotions, and offer you products and services we believe may be of interest to you\n- Measure interest in and improve our products, services, and Site\n- Enable you to communicate with us through our blogs, social networks and other interactive media\n- Publish your testimonials about Jetsetter, including on our Site and blogs, and on social networks\n- Create content for advertisements or marketing campaigns, including emails\n- Manage your participation in our events, sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions\n- Tailor our products and services to suit your personal interests and the manner in which visitors use our Site, App, and social media assets\n- Operate, evaluate, and improve our business and the products and services we offer\n- Analyze and enhance our marketing communications and strategies (including by identifying when emails sent to you have been received and read)\n- Analyze trends and statistics regarding visitors\u2019 use of our Site, App, and social media assets, and the purchases visitors make on our sites\n- Protect against and prevent fraud, unauthorized transactions, claims, and other liabilities, and manage risk exposure, including by identifying potential hackers and other unauthorized users\n- Enforce our [Website Terms of Use](https:\/\/www.jetsetter.com\/websiteterms) and [Terms of Service](https:\/\/www.jetsetter.com\/terms-of-service)\n- Comply with applicable legal requirements and industry standards and our policies\n\nIn addition to the data uses described above, we may use the information collected through cookies and other automated means to uniquely identify the electronic shopping basket you may create on our Site and enable you to retrieve shopping baskets you previously created.

We may use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us; to communicate with you about products, services and events that may be of interest to you; for other promotional purposes; and for other purposes described in this section.

Throughout Jetsetter and its affiliated sites, all products and services provided by third-party suppliers are described as such. Information that we share with suppliers to facilitate reservations will be treated according to applicable suppliers\u2019 privacy policies, except for payment information. We share payment information only when it is necessary for travel reservations facilitated through or made on Jetsetter, and we restrict suppliers\u2019 use of payment information for these purposes. We encourage you to review the privacy policies, terms of use, and other policies of any travel supplier whose products and services you may purchase through Jetsetter. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or your travel plans, to facilitate your travel reservations, or for other purposes consistent with the practices described in their privacy policies and terms of use.\n- ++Third-party vendors++ who provide services or functions on our behalf, including business analytics; payment processing; customer service; marketing; public relations; distribution of surveys, contests, or sweepstakes programs; and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including, for example, as necessary to operate features of our Site or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests.

This sharing enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. To the extent that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email messages in the future.\n\nWe also may share your information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary for any of the following reasons:\n\n- To comply with legitimate and enforceable subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.\n- To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Jetsetter, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Website Terms of Use and other agreements.\n- In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.\n\nIf you choose to create any kind of profile on Jetsetter, certain information in your profile will be publicly viewable and identifiable via your username.

We will apply your preferences going forward. In some circumstances, withdrawing your consent to Jetsetter\u2019s use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you cannot take advantage of certain Jetsetter offerings or site features.\n\nHere are the choices we offer:\n\n_**Sharing Information with Business Partners**_\n\nYou may direct Jetsetter not to share your personal information with our business partners for those partners\u2019 own purposes.

If you opt out, we will continue sharing your information as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, including with our service providers, to fulfill your requests and to comply with legal requirements.\n\n_**Marketing Emails**_\n\nYou may choose not to receive marketing email communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the marketing emails or by adjusting your email preferences using the online account you may establish on our Site.\n\n_**Web Analytics**_\n\nJetsetter uses a web analytics company to track and generate reports on visitor use of Jetsetter. We use the web analytics company to analyze visitor activity so that we may better understand how visitors make use of the Site, and so that we may better tailor content to meet our visitors' needs. This data may include individual visitor click behavior. However, no personally identifiable information is shared with the web analytics company.

For instructions on changing the relevant settings please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.\n\n_**Cookies**_\n\nMost browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our Site\u2019s features. In addition, disabling cookies may cancel opt-outs that rely on cookies, such as web analytics or targeted advertising opt-outs.\n\n**How we protect personal information**\n\nWe maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to assist us in protecting the personal information we collect against accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use.
