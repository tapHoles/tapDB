<p class="page-header-description">Effective August 8, 2014</p>
<div class="container">
<p>Please read these Terms of Service (collectively with Bitly, Inc.’s Privacy Policy [<a title="Bitly, Inc's Privacy Policy" href="/pages/privacy">https://www.bitly.com/pages/privacy</a>] and DMCA Copyright Policy [<a title="Bitly's DMCA Copyright Policy" href="/pages/dmca-copyright-policy">https://www.bitly.com/pages/dmca-copyright-policy</a>], the “Terms of Service”) fully and carefully before using the services, features, and content offered by Bitly, Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “Bitly”) through its website, plugins, or software applications (collectively, the “Services”).

</p>

</ol>
<h3>2. Modification</h3>
<p>Bitly reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms of Service, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Services (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice or by sending you notice through the Services or by e-mail.

You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms of Service are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you and the right to access the Services is revoked where these Terms of Service or use of the Services is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale or provision of the Services conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation. Further, the Services are offered only for your use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party.</p>
<h3>4. Registration</h3>
