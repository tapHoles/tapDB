                <p>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Piazza, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following paragraph, any claim or dispute  arising in connection with the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
                <p>For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under these Terms where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("<strong>ADR</strong>") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>These Terms, together with any amendments and additional agreements you may enter into with Piazza in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Piazza concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.  These Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Piazza and you regarding the Service. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement (or any portion thereof) and any agreement between Piazza and your School, the terms of the agreement with your school shall prevail.</p>
                <p>No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Piazza's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
                <p>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Piazza without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
