			<h2>With whom we share your information</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Personal information.</strong> We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share information, including personal information, with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service (including through our users who moderate flagged content for the OkCupid community) and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, ad tracking and analytics, member screenings, supporting our website or application functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Services. We may also share your name, contact information and credit card information with our service providers who process credit card payments. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Business partners:</strong> When you register or make purchases on our Services or click-through our advertisements offered on third party websites or applications, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you the applicable products, services or any advertisements. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other information to that merchant.

We may share information we collect, including your profile and personal information such as your name and contact information, photos, interests, activities and transactions on our website, with Match Group companies.

			<p>
				<strong>Other Situations.</strong> We also may disclose your information, including personal information:
			</p>
			<p>
				In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.
			</p>
			<p>
				In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

			<p>
				<strong>Aggregated and/or non-personal-information.</strong> We may share non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with Match Group companies and third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, writers, researchers, partners, advertisers and investors for the purpose of conducting general business analysis, advertising, marketing, or other business purposes. For example, we may engage a data provider who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. We may also share your geolocation information in de-identified form with Match Group companies and third parties for the above purposes. To opt out of the sharing of your geolocation information, please discontinue use of your OkCupid application.

			<h2>Onward transfer and consent to international processing</h2>

			<p>
				We are a growing corporation with users and operations in multiple countries, including the European Union. We have developed data practices designed to assure information is appropriately protected but we cannot always know where personal information may be accessed or processed. While our primary data centers are in the United States, we may transfer personal information or other information to our offices outside of the United States. In addition, we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. If we disclose personal information to a third party or to our employees outside of the United States, we will seek assurances that any information we may provide to them is safeguarded adequately and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the requirements of applicable privacy laws.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use</u>, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal data, including sensitive data, by OkCupid from your region to countries which do not have data protection laws that provide the same level of protection that exists in countries in the European Economic Area, including the United States.

			<h2>Third-party websites</h2>
			<p>
				There are a number of places on our Services where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our Services, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>How you can access and correct your information</h2>
			<p>
				If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account and clicking on Settings. Applicable privacy laws may allow any individual the right to access and/or request the correction of errors or omissions in his or her personal information that is in our custody or under our control. Our Privacy Officer will assist the individual with the access request. This includes:
				<ol>
					<li>identification of personal information under our custody or control; and</li>
					<li>information about how personal information under our control may be or has been used by us.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>
				In certain exceptional circumstances, we may not be able to provide access to certain personal information it holds about an individual.

			<h2>Data retention</h2>

			<p>
				If you have an online account with us, you may delete or disable your account at any time by visiting the "Settings" page for your account. If you delete or disable your account, we will retain certain data for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Services or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.

		<div class="help_section">
			<h2>Your choices about collection and use of your information</h2>
			<p>
				You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Services because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you register on our Services, you consent to receive email messages from us. At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by submitting this request to <a href="mailto:privacy@okcupid.com">privacy@okcupid.com</a>. You may be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. We request a reasonable time to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications, will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.

			<p>
				Our applications may also deliver notifications to your phone or mobile device. You can disable these notifications in your device’s settings in your account under “Settings” or by deleting the relevant application.

			<h2>Advertising Opt-Out</h2>

			<h2>How we protect your personal information</h2>
			<p>
				We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. We want you to feel confident using our Services to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
			</p>
			<p>
				You agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues, such as security breaches. We may post a notice on our Service if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), please notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@okcupid.com">privacy@okcupid.com</a>.

			<h2>Information you provide about yourself while using our service</h2>
			<p>
				We provide areas on our Services where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our <a href="/legal/terms">Terms & Conditions</a>. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.

We do not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your device, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites or other data they have collected.
