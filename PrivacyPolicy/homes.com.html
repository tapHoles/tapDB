					<p>"Web beacons" or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a Web page to monitor behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Web page. For example, Web beacons or similar technology can be used to count the users who visit a website or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use Web beacons or similar technology on our Services from time to time for this and other purposes.</p>
					<h3>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Services, Ad Servers and Sponsors</h3>
					<p>Our Services may contain links to other websites or services whose information practices may be different than ours.  For example, while using one or more of our websites, you may link to a third party's website via a window opened within (or on top of) our website.  Some of our Services may allow users to interface with third party websites or services, such as Facebook and Twitter.  You will remain logged into those third party websites or services until you actively log off.  By interfacing with those third party websites or services, you are allowing our Services to access your information that is or becomes available via such third party websites or services, and you are agreeing to those third party's applicable terms and conditions.  Once you log onto any such third party websites or services, the content you post there may also post to our Services.  Our <a href="http://www.dominionenterprises.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> and procedures may or may not be consistent with the policies and procedures of such third party websites or services, and when you visit such websites or services our <a href="http://www.dominionenterprises.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> does not apply to personally identifiable information and other data collected by the third party.  You should consult, read and understand the privacy notices of such third parties before choosing to provide personally identifiable information on any such websites or services.</p>
					<p>Our Services may also use a third party ad server to present the advertisements that you may see on our Services. These third party ad servers may use cookies, Web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our <a href="http://www.dominionenterprises.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
					<h3>California Do Not Track Notice</h3>
					<p>Certain websites and other technology can track their users over time to, for instance, provide targeted advertising.  Do Not Track ("DNT") mechanisms allow Internet users to control, and where desired prevent, the tracking of their online activities across such websites and technology.  Currently, various Internet browsers offer a DNT option that sends signals to websites visited by the browser about the users DNT preference - you can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences.  Specifically as DNT relates to your use of our Services, we currently do not have the capability to recognize or respond to web browser Do Not Track signals and other similar mechanisms.</p>
					<h3>Canada's Anti-Spam Law</h3>
					<p>Commercial electronic messages that are sent from or accessed in Canada, including emails and text messages ("CEMs"), are governed by Canada's Anti-Spam Law and its relevant rules and regulations ("CASL"). CASL requires that any CEMs sent to Canadian recipients in connection with our Services comply with certain consent and informational requirements (generally speaking, CASL prohibits sending CEMs to Canadian recipients without the prior consent of the recipient).  Consent may either be implied (which is temporary) or express (which is permanent, unless and until withdrawn).  Examples of implied consent to receive CEMs include (i) your having purchased something from us within the past two years, (ii) your download of software included within our Services or (iii) your giving us your business card at a trade show.  You provide express consent when you affirmatively elect to receive CEMs in response to a clear solicitation to do so (for instance, filling out a form on one of our websites where the form clearly states that you will receive CEMs from Dominion).  When applicable, Dominion will ask for your express consent to receive CEMs, and will respect your decision.  Under any circumstances, however, you have the right to withdraw your consent -- whether express or implied -- by completing our <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.dominionenterprises.com/main/do/DE_Email_Opt_Out_Form">Email Opt Out Form</a> or by contacting us via the contact information provided below.</p>

					<p>We work to protect the security of your personally identifiable information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

					<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password, your computer and your mobile device(s). Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Additionally, change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure Web browser.</p>
					<h3>How You Can Access or Correct Information</h3>
					<p>You may obtain information regarding the personally identifiable information that you provide or we collect about you via our Services for the limited purpose of viewing and correcting any factual errors in such information. Access to personally identifiable information that you provide or we collect via our Services may be accessible for a limited period of time after the point of collection. For example, if you created a password-protected account within our Services, you may return to that portion of the Services to review the personally identifiable information you provided. Alternatively, you may send an e-mail or letter to the following e-mail or street address requesting information about or corrections to your personally identifiable information Dominion Enterprises, Intellectual Property Administrator, P.O.
