<p>We use other third party service providers such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services or an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. Such third party service providers may collect PII from you directly and their use of your PII will be subject to the terms of their privacy policy. We will provide your PII to such service providers so that they can assist us in providing our service to you. These third parties are contractually prohibited from using your PII for their own promotional purposes.</p>

<p>IMVU may also report to law enforcement or other appropriate government authorities any actions that may be suspicious or illegal, and any reports it receives of such conduct and in conjunction with such report, may disclose your PII to law enforcement or other appropriate government authorities. If we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority, to enforce our terms of use, to protect other users or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation of a governmental authority, IMVU will disclose your PII and may cooperate with law enforcement or appropriate government agencies.</p>

(&quot;NAI&quot;) Principles. You may learn more about the NAI Principles and opt-out of receiving targeted ad programs certain third party advertisers provide at
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>.

<h2 id='co-branded'>Co-branded sites</h2>
<p>Some pages may have the look and feel of our Site or App (i.e. www.imvu.com), however these pages are served by a third party and information collected on these pages is not covered under our Privacy Policy.

<h2 id='pii-secured'>How is your PII retained &amp; secured?</h2>
<p>We employ procedural and technological measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your PII from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. IMVU may use firewalls, password protection, secure socket layer, database encryption, and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your PII.</p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<h2 id='eu-notice'>Notice to Users outside of the United States of America</h2>
<p>The information you enter on this Site or App or otherwise provide to IMVU may be transferred outside of your country to the United States of America and other jurisdictions which does not offer an equivalent level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. In particular, you are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in other countries, particularly the European Union, and to the processing of that information by IMVU on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy. In our discretion, we may adopt other means or enter into a program under applicable law for ensuring adequate safeguards.</p>

<h2 id='update-pii'>Correction/Updating PII</h2>
<p>IMVU provides you with the ability to review, correct and delete the PII that you have provided to us in your account. If you wish to review or correct any information you have provided to us, you may access your account and review, correct, and/or delete your PII by logging into your account and selecting
&quot;Account Settings&quot;. If you are a minor between the ages of 13 and 18, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@imvu.com">privacy@imvu.com</a> to remove certain content that you have submitted on the Site and App.</p>
