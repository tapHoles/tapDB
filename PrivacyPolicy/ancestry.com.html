<p>At Ancestry, your privacy is a top priority. Ancestry is committed to always being a good steward of your Personal Information, handling it in a responsible manner, and securing it with industry standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. Ancestry follows three guiding principles when it comes to your privacy:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
	<li><strong>Transparency</strong>. We work hard to be transparent about what Personal Information we collect and process.</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>. We strive to use easy-to-understand language to describe our privacy practices to help you make informed choices.</li>
	<li><strong>Control</strong>. We give you control over the Personal Information you provide to us, including your DNA Data, and how it is used, shared, and retained.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Other Important Things for You to Understand When You Use Our Services</strong></p>

<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>You always maintain ownership of your DNA and DNA Data&mdash;you can manage and delete it as described in this Statement.</li>
	<li>You may discover unanticipated facts about yourself or your family when using our services. While we strive to give you control as you use the Services, once discoveries are made, we can&rsquo;t undo it.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you make new discoveries with us, you should feel confident and informed about how we use your Personal Information. Our full Privacy Statement is below and we encourage you to read it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Information We Collect From You</strong></p>

<p><strong>Account Information</strong> includes your name, email address, and a password that you provide us when you create an Ancestry account, and your phone number that we may collect to notify you of DNA test result status, or when you contact Ancestry Member Services by phone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Credit Card/Payment Information:</strong> We collect payment information, such as your credit card number, and your billing and shipping address(es), when you purchase an Ancestry subscription or a DNA test kit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DNA Kit Activation Information:</strong> When you activate a DNA test kit, we collect your DNA test kit code, your sex and year of birth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Profile Information:</strong> We collect the information that you provide when you voluntarily create a user profile. This information may be seen by other users of the Services. If you do not enhance your Ancestry profile to include personal details (for example, a profile image, your name, age, location, etc.), only your username will be visible to other Ancestry members.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>User Provided Content:</strong> We collect the information voluntarily provided by you when you populate your family tree, including stories, images, and any details about living individuals you list in your family tree. Information about deceased persons is not Personal Information under this Statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="GeneticInformation"></a><strong>Genetic Information:</strong> We extract your DNA from your saliva at our partner laboratory when you submit it in the tube provided with your AncestryDNA test kit. We convert your DNA into machine-readable code (&ldquo;DNA Data&rdquo;), which is then used to provide you an ethnicity estimate as well as other information about you. For clarity, the Genetic Information we collect consists of:</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>Your DNA Data;</li>
	<li>Information derived from your DNA Data. This includes your ethnicity estimate, your connection to genetic relatives in our database, and any genetic markers associated with physical traits, such as hair color or traits associated with your health and wellness. A &lsquo;genetic marker&rsquo; is basically a DNA sequence or sequences that may identify a certain trait.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A note about your DNA and Saliva:</strong> Once our laboratory partner has produced your DNA Data, the DNA and saliva (also referred to as &ldquo;biological samples&rdquo;) are stored so that they can be available for future testing. Such future testing may be done under our <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/dna/legal/informedConsent/latest" target="_blank">Informed Consent to Research</a> or otherwise if you consent. <a href="#YourInfoAccess">Section 7</a> below describes how you can control both your DNA Data and your biological samples.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Your Comments and Communications:</strong> We collect information in any comments you voluntarily post on our Services. We also collect information you provide when you participate in community discussions, chats, or when you communicate with other members using Ancestry&rsquo;s messaging platform. Any information you provide in these areas can be read, collected, and used by other participants in these communications. We also collect information you provide in communications with Ancestry Member Services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Contests and Promotions:</strong> We collect Personal Information when you voluntarily participate in contests and special promotions we run through our Services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Please refer to that policy to learn about our practices and the controls we provide you.</p>

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the applicable social network company.</p>

These partners include our laboratory partners, DNA test shipping providers, credit card processors, cloud services infrastructure providers, biological sample storage facilities, and vendors that assist us in marketing, analytics, fraud prevention, and Member Support.</li>
	<li><strong>Research Partners:</strong> We share your Genetic Information with research partners only when you provide us with your express consent to do so through our Informed Consent to Research. By agreeing to the <a class="underline" href="http://www.ancestry.com/dna/legal/informedConsent/latest" target="_blank">Informed Consent to Research</a> you agree to the specified uses described in that document. Research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct or support scientific research or conduct or support the development of therapeutics, medical devices or related material to treat, diagnose or predict health conditions. In some circumstances, a research partner or Ancestry may have a financial interest in the research arrangement. A list of our research partners can be found <a class="underline" href="http://www.ancestry.com/cs/collaborations" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>For Legal or Regulatory Process:</strong> We may share your Personal Information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:
	<ul class="bulleted">
		<li>Comply with valid legal process (e.g., subpoenas, warrants);</li>
		<li>Enforce or apply the Ancestry Terms and Conditions;</li>
		<li>Protect the security or integrity of the Services; or</li>
		<li>Protect the rights, property, or safety, of Ancestry, our employees or users.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If we are compelled to disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement, we will do our best to provide you with advance notice, unless we are prohibited under the law from doing so. In the interest of transparency, Ancestry produces a <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency" target="_blank">Transparency Report</a> where we list the number of valid law enforcement requests for user data across all our sites.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>If Ancestry is Acquired:</strong> In the event that Ancestry or its businesses are acquired or transferred to another entity (in whole or part and including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we will share your Personal Information with that entity. The promises in this Privacy Statement will apply to your Personal Information as transferred to the new entity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A note about aggregated data:</strong> Ancestry may disclose user information in an aggregated form as part of the Services or our marketing, or in scientific publications published by us or our research partners. For example, we might note the percentage of immigrants in a State that are from a particular geographic region or country. Such publications will never include Personal Information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="Deletion"></a><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your Personal Information from Ancestry in a number of ways through the settings linked above. If you require assistance deleting Personal Information you provided as part of your profile or subscription or from our blog or community forum, please submit a detailed deletion request (including the exact wording of the information as it appears on the websites, and the URL where that information is found) to our <a href="https://support.ancestry.com/s/contactsupport" target="_blank">Member Services team</a>. Please note however, if you have shared information through the Services (for example, by making your family trees public, or by sharing your DNA Results directly with other users), Ancestry will not be able to remove any copies of information that other Ancestry members may have retained.</p>

<p>Additionally, Ancestry may hold records that contain your Personal Information that we are obligated to maintain as archives. Please direct any request to remove information from linked archival records to the responsible archival entity. We will consider requests for removal of Personal Information from the searchable indexes of the records we hold on a case-by-case basis and will endeavor to fully respect your requests to remove Personal Information. Additionally, some of your Personal Information may be included in other Ancestry members&rsquo; family trees, which will only be removed if the other Ancestry member deletes it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Deletion of Genetic Information:</strong> If you request that Ancestry delete your DNA Data, we will delete all Genetic Information, including any derivative Genetic Information (ethnicity estimates, genetic relative matches, etc.) from our production, development, analytics, and research systems within 30 days. To <strong>request the destruction of your biological samples, you must contact <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/cs/contact-us" target="_blank">Member Services</a>. Please note</strong> that if you have agreed to our <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/dna/legal/informedConsent/latest" target="_blank">Informed Consent to Research</a>, we will not be able to remove your Genetic Information from active or completed research projects, but we will not use it for any new research projects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Generally:</strong> All Ancestry data, including Personal Information, will persist in our backup systems after it has been deleted from our production, development, analytics, and research systems for up to 6 months before it is overwritten. Also, our laboratory partners may retain information they receive from us in order to comply with laws or regulations that may require them to do so, such as the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Ancestry may also retain certain information for tax and payment industry regulatory compliance purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Security</strong></p>

<p>Ancestry maintains a comprehensive information security program designed to protect our customers&rsquo; Personal Information using administrative, physical, and technical safeguards based on the sensitivity of the Personal Information collected. We have measures in place to protect against inappropriate access, loss, misuse, or alteration of Personal Information (including Genetic Information) under our control. Ancestry&rsquo;s Security Team regularly reviews our security and privacy practices and enhances them as necessary to help ensure the integrity of our systems and your Personal Information. We use secure server software to encrypt Personal Information (including Genetic Information), and we only partner with security companies that meet and commit to our security standards. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use reasonable efforts to prevent this. It is also important for you to guard against unauthorized access to your Personal Information by maintaining strong passwords and protecting against the unauthorized use of your own computer or device.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Transfer</strong></p>

<p>Any transfer of your Personal and Genetic Information, between Ancestry&rsquo;s U.S.-based company for processing in Ireland or Ancestry&rsquo;s Ireland-based company for processing in the United States, is conducted pursuant to established transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory Compliance and Dispute Resolution</strong></p>

<p>We seek to resolve all privacy matters reported to us. However, if you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, you can also contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Users outside of the United States may contact the <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Home/4.htm" target="_blank">Irish Data Protection Commission</a>, or your local Data Protection Authority.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>California&rsquo;s Shine the Light Law</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the &ldquo;Shine the Light&rdquo; law, permits Users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. Under Section 1798.83, Ancestry currently does not share any Personal Information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Do-Not-Track Disclosure</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ancestry notes that although we do our best to honor your privacy preferences, and have implemented industry standard safeguards as described above, we do not respond to Do-Not-Track signals from your browser at this time due to the lack of an established industry standard. Ancestry uses advertising technology to show you advertising relevant to your Ancestry experience. Also, when Ancestry uses other companies&rsquo; services, data, and software tools to target advertising to you, these companies may collect information (such as a unique cookie or mobile identifier) about your online activities over time and across other websites or services on our behalf. Controls to help you manage this type of tracking via advertising are detailed in our <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/AboutCookies" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
