<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Effective and Last Modified: January 31, 2015</em></p>
<p>This policy (“Privacy Policy”) informs you of the policies of Salem Communications Corporation and its subsidiary entities (collectively, “Salem”) concerning the collection, use and disclosure of personal information from this and other Salem-related websites (the “Website(s)”). Because we may gather certain types of information about our users and understand your privacy is important to you, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. Even though we may need to collect information about you to provide some of the products and services we offer, you may not want us to disclose that information to others. Accordingly, what follows is a description of how we gather and use information about you (collectively “Your Information”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand what information we collect through our Websites, what we do with that information, and how to safeguard personal information you provide to us.</p>
<p>Please note that by visiting this Website you consent to the collection of Your Information by Salem as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclosure of Personal Information to Outside Parties:</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Except as set forth in this policy, Salem does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. However, Salem may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related Website information to third-party vendors.

<p><strong><em>h) Combining Information.</em></strong> Please note that all of the information we collect about you may be combined, including to help us tailor our communications to you and to develop rich online content and services across the Salem Websites.</p>
<p><strong><em>i) Public Forums.</em></strong> This Website makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Any information you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. We cannot safeguard the privacy of any such information you choose to disclose online in this manner and you must do so carefully and at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong><em>j) User-Generated Content.</em></strong> Some Salem Websites enable users to submit their own content for contests, blogs, videos, message boards and other functions. Publication of user generated content on the Salem Websites is subject to the terms and rules contained in our Terms of Use for our Websites. Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose your contact, financial and other information in a submission. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.</p>
<p><strong><em>k) Banner Advertising.</em></strong> We license ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising on our Websites. All of the data provided and generated by such software will remain in our possession and no data will be transferred to the licensor of the software. This feature of our Websites may, on occasion, set “cookies” on your computer. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is treated in the same manner as other information as described in this statement.</p>
<p><strong><em>l) Confirmed Opt-In.</em></strong> Salem acquires no personal or registration data about our users except what you explicitly and voluntarily provide (i.e., via opt-in). We reserve the right to use this information specifically for the purposes related to your registration in addition to any other purpose set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong><em>m) Feedback Data.</em></strong> Feedback data is voluntary information (e.g., success stories) provided directly by you for the purposes of assessing the products or services provided through Salem Websites. There are areas on Salem-owned Websites which allow you to submit feedback. Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes the property of Salem, and we reserve the right to use this information for the purposes of marketing, quality control, or to contact you for further information.</p>
<p><strong><em>n) Usage (Log) Data. </em></strong>Salem also gathers and analyzes usage or log data including your IP (internet protocol) address assigned by your ISP (internet service provider), the type of operating system you are using on your computer, and the type of web browser you are using to view our Website. Salem management uses usage or log data to help diagnose problems with and optimize performance of the server. This information also allows us to evaluate user traffic patterns into, out from, and within our Website. These uses, however, do not allow us to connect your IP address with your personal identity.</p>
<p><strong><em>o) What About “Cookies”?</em></strong> “Cookies” are small pieces of information that your web browser stores on your computer&#8217;s hard drive which may contain personally identifying information. From time to time our Website may place cookies on your computer’s hard drive that enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide you with certain features. Use of cookies also provides information about your web usage, which helps us compile demographic and statistical information about visitors who are utilizing our Website. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> 3. Updating and Deleting Personal Data:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em>a) Correcting and Updating. </em></strong>You may correct or update your registration data by either signing into your online account or by using the “Contact Us” link on our Website to submit such request.</p>
<p><strong><em>b) Delete/Deactivate/Opt-out of Email Subscriptions.</em></strong> You may delete or deactivate your account or request not to receive emails from us by either signing into your online account or by using the “Contact Us” link on our Website and submitting a request to delete/deactivate your account or be removed from our database. Salem will comply with all such requests within a reasonable period of time. Please note that we may need to retain some information about you in order to satisfy our legal and security obligations; for example, some of your information may remain in backup storage even if you ask us to delete it. In some cases, you may be entitled under local laws to access or object to the possession of information that we hold relating to you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4. Information Shared With Third Parties:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em>            </em></strong>We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our website for their own use and subject to their own privacy policies. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at www.aboutads.info and Networking Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.</p>

<p>Additionally, from time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by Salem to provide additional features on our Websites. These special relationships may include “powered by” partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “co-branded pages”). You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our third party partner. You should also check our partner’s website for information regarding its privacy policies. Additionally, the nature of some features of our Website may require that we share personal information about you with persons or companies outside of the Salem corporate enterprise. For example, this may occur with a feature that enables you, via our Website, to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of the Salem enterprise. By responding to those features of the Website, whether by email or direct entry of information on our Website, you are consenting to our transferring of that information to such persons or entities.</p>
<p><strong><em>b) Links to Other Sites.</em></strong> When you visit Salem Websites, you may be linked to other outside sites. This includes links to sites operated by advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use Salem&#8217;s logo as part of an agreement with Salem. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit Your Information. These other sites may be developed by people over whom Salem exercises no control and, as such, are not subject to the Salem Privacy Policy. Salem is not responsible for the privacy policies of these other sites, nor for the use of any of Your Information that these sites may collect.</p>

Accordingly, we believe we have appropriate security measures in place, consistent with standard industry practice, to protect against the unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, misuse or destruction of data.

As such, while we want you to feel confident using the Salem Websites, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</p>
<p><em><strong>b) Enforcement.</strong> </em>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy and will respond accordingly to any formal written complaints, including, if necessary, working with the appropriate regulatory authority to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>
