	<p class="wpText mb1">
		Welcome to PeopleSmart.com, a website designed to help you find information available in public records.
		This privacy policy is for visitors and registered users ("you") of PeopleSmart.com (the "website" or "service"), which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc. (“Inflection”, "we" or "our"):
	</p>
	<p class="wpText">

<h2 class="wpSubTitle">
	What is covered by this privacy policy?
</h2>
<p class="wpText mb1">
	This privacy policy covers PeopleSmart.com, which is designed to help you find public records information about yourself and others. This site is not a consumer-reporting agency as defined by the <a href="https://www.peoplesmart.com/fcra" target="_blank">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA). Visit <a href="https://www.goodhire.com/gh.aspx?_act=landing&cam=6336" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GoodHire.com</a> for all your employment screening needs.
</p>

<h2 class="wpSubTitle">
	What isn’t covered by this policy?
</h2>
<p class="wpText">
	This privacy policy only applies to information collected by this website, which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc. This policy does not apply to the practices of other website domains that this site links to, to other Inflection services, to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.

</p>
<p class="wpText mb1">
	If you choose to opt out of search results, that choice may affect the visibility of the relevant information on our entire network of sites, which includes this website, Identity.com, and other affiliated properties.

If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. Please see the “What This Policy Covers”.
</p>
<h2 class="wpSubTitle">
	Your safety and privacy are very important to us
</h2>
<p class="wpText mb1">

Please contact us if you are particularly at risk for certain types of harm as a result of your public records being available on this site. Inflection will work with you on mitigating the risk of any potential harm, including physical harm, threats to public officials such as law enforcement, and issues related to identity theft.

</p>
<p class="wpText">
