<p>Bertheussen IT reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or revise these Terms at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Any such change or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Service, and your continued use of the Service after any changes or modifications to these Terms are posted will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to, such changes or modifications. If you object to any change or modification, your sole recourse shall be to cease using the Service.</p>

<h3>2. Rights to Use the Service</h3>
<p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Bertheussen IT grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use and access the Service, solely for your personal, non-commercial use.</p>

<p>You agree not to (and not to attempt to) (i) use the Service for any use or purpose other than as expressly permitted by these Terms or (ii) copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Service or any portion of the Service, except as expressly permitted in these Terms. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Bertheussen IT or its licensors, except for the permissions and rights expressly granted in these Terms.</p>

<p>If you violate these Terms, Bertheussen IT reserves the right to issue you a warning regarding the violation or immediately terminate or suspend any or all accounts you have created using the Service.

<p>Bertheussen IT reserves the right to refuse any user access to the Services without notice for violation of the Terms.</p>

<h3>3. Intellectual Property/Ownership</h3>
<p>All rights, title and interest in and to all materials that are part of the Service (including, but not limited to, designs, text, graphics, pictures, video, information, applications, software, music, sound and other files, and their selection and arrangement), except for “User Content” (as defined below), collectively referred to as the “Service Materials”, are, as between Bertheussen IT and you, owned by Bertheussen IT and/or its third party licensors. You acknowledge and agree that you shall not acquire any ownership rights whatsoever by downloading Service Materials.</p>

<p>You agree that you shall not modify, copy, distribute, frame, reproduce, republish, download, scrape, display, post, transmit, or sell in any form or by any means, in whole or in part, or otherwise exploit the Service Materials without Bertheussen IT's express prior written permission.

<h3>4. User Content</h3>
<p>Any data, text, graphics, photographs and their selection and arrangement, and any other materials uploaded to the Service by you or other users (hereinafter "User Content") are subject, whether in whole or in part, to unlimited commercial, non-commercial and/or promotional use by Bertheussen IT. All User Content is the sole responsibility of the person from whom the User Content originated. Thus, users are responsible, and Bertheussen IT is not responsible for any files users upload, post, or otherwise make available.

<p>You represent and warrant that User Content you transmit or submit is original to you and that you exclusively own the rights to such content, including the right to grant all of the rights and licenses in these Terms without Bertheussen IT incurring any third party obligations or liability arising out of its exercise of such rights and licenses.</p>

<p>You hereby grant to Bertheussen IT a worldwide, irrevocable (as long as your account is not terminated), perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid-up and royalty-free license, (with the right to sublicense), to use, copy, adapt, modify, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast and otherwise exploit User Content you transmit or submit and all derivative works. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, you hereby waive any moral rights you may have in User Content.</p>
