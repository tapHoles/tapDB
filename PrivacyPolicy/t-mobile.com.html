<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>T-Mobile Terms &amp; Conditions</strong></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Effective as of September 20, 2017</p>

<p>Thanks for choosing T-Mobile. Please read these Terms &amp; Conditions (&#147;T&amp;Cs&#148;), which contain important information about your relationship with T-Mobile, including mandatory arbitration of disputes between us, instead of class actions or jury trials. You will become bound by these provisions once you accept these T&amp;Cs.</p>

<p><strong>WHO IS THIS AGREEMENT WITH?</strong></p>

<p>These T&amp;Cs are an agreement between you and us, T-Mobile USA, Inc., and our controlled subsidiaries, assignees, and agents.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DO I ACCEPT THESE T&amp;Cs?</strong></p>

<p>You accept these T&amp;Cs by doing any of the following things:</p>

<ul>
    <li>giving us a written or electronic signature or confirmation, or telling us orally that you accept;</li>

    <li>activating, using or paying for the Service or a Device; or</li>

    <li>opening the Device box.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don&#146;t want to accept these T&amp;Cs, don&#146;t do any of these things.</p>

<p>When you accept, you're telling us that you are of legal age (which means you are either legally emancipated, or have reached the age of majority as defined in your jurisdiction) and that you are able to enter into a contract. If you accept for an organization, you're telling us that you are authorized to bind that organization, and references to "you" in these T&amp;Cs may mean the organization.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS?</strong></p>

<p>In these T&amp;Cs, you'll find important information about:</p>

<ul>
    <li>T-Mobile services provided to you (&#147;Services&#148;);</li>

    <li>Any equipment for which we provide Service, such as a phone, handset, tablet, or SIM card (collectively, a &#147;Device&#148;);</li>

    <li>Any charges, taxes, fees, and other amounts we bill you or that were accepted or processed through your Device (&#147;Charges&#148;);</li>

    <li>Privacy information;</li>

    <li>Network management practices;</li>

    <li>Limitations of liability; and</li>

    <li>Resolution of disputes by arbitration and class action waiver (full terms available <a href="#Dispute Resolution">here</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ARE THERE ANY OTHER TERMS THAT APPLY TO ME?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Your &#147;Agreement&#148; includes these T&amp;Cs, the additional terms found in your Rate Plan, your Data Plan, your Service Agreement, and provisions linked to from these T&amp;Cs. Sections marked &#147;*&#148; continue after termination of our Agreement with you.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that our <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="http://www.t-mobile.com/company/website/privacypolicy.aspx" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="http://www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet" target="_blank">Open Internet Policy</a> apply to the use of our products and services.</p>

<p>You might also have other agreements with us, such as an equipment installment plan or JUMP! On Demand Lease Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>*HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH T-MOBILE?</strong></p>

<p>By accepting these T&amp;Cs, you are agreeing to resolve any dispute with us through binding arbitration (unless you opt out) or small claims dispute procedures, and to waive your rights to a class action suit and jury trial. Your complete arbitration agreement, including opt-out instructions, is available <a href="#Dispute Resolution">here</a>, and the opt-out website is available <a href="https://www.t-mobiledisputeresolution.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. For additional terms and conditions governing a dispute between us, including how to dispute Charges assessed to you on your bill, choice of law, disclaimers of certain warranties, limitations of liabilities, and your indemnification obligations, <a href="#OTRDR">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS A RATE PLAN?</strong></p>

<p>Your &#147;Rate Plan&#148; includes your Service allotments, for example, for minutes, messages or data, rates, coverage and other terms. You can check your current usage by visiting my.T-mobile.com, or by using a short code from your Device (you can find more information about the short code at www.t-mobile.com). If any term in your Rate Plan conflicts with these T&Cs, the term in your Rate Plan governs.</p>

<p><strong>HOW WILL I BE CHARGED FOR DATA USAGE?</strong></p>

<p>Data service may be included in your Rate Plan or data pass or you may be charged for data usage on a pay per use basis (“Data Plan”). Your Rate Plan and/or Data Plan will contain more information about how we calculate data usage. You can check your current usage by visiting my.T-mobile.com or by using a short code from your device (you can find more information about the short code at www.t-mobile.com). If you do not have a Data Plan, your Device may not be able to access data services. </p>

<p><strong>ARE THERE SEPARATE TERMS FOR PREPAID CUSTOMERS?</strong></p>

<p>The terms of these T&amp;Cs apply to prepaid customers, and additional terms specific to prepaid customers may be <a href="#Additional Terms for Prepaid Customers">found here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DO I GIVE OTHER PEOPLE ACCESS TO MY ACCOUNT?</strong></p>

<p>If you want someone else to be able to access and manage your account, you can establish them as an &#147;Authorized User,&#148; so they can:</p>

<ul type="disc">
    <li>Make changes to your account;</li>

    <li>Add or remove services or features to your account;</li>

    <li>Receive notices and disclosures on your behalf;</li>

    <li>Purchase Devices for use with our Service, including under an installment plan; and</li>

    <li>Incur Charges on your account.</li>
</ul>

<p>The easiest way to designate an Authorized User is through your my.T-mobile.com account. Keep in mind that you should not share your account validation information, which includes the last four digits of your social security number or your passcode. This information is sensitive so take steps to protect it. We will treat presentation of the proper account validation information as authorized access to an account.</p>

<p><strong>WHERE, HOW, AND WHEN DOES MY SERVICE WORK?</strong></p>

<p>These T&amp;Cs describe the experience you can expect on our network, including information about our reasonable network management practices, and the experience on our roaming partners&#146; networks:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Please check our coverage maps, which approximate our anticipated coverage area outdoors. Your experience on our network may vary and change without notice depending on a variety of factors. For more information, <a href="#UsingOurNetwork">click here</a>. You agree that we are not liable for problems relating to Service availability or quality.</li>

    <li>For more information about roaming, <a href="#Roaming">click here</a>.</li>

    <li>To provide the best possible experience for the most possible customers on T-Mobile branded plans, we prioritize the data usage of a small percentage of our heavy data users, specifically those using more than 50GB of data in a billing cycle below that of other customers in times and locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources. This threshold number is periodically evaluated and may change over time. We prioritize smartphone and mobile internet (tablet) over Smartphone Mobile HotSpot (tethering) traffic on our network. <a href="#UsingOurNetwork">Click here</a> for more information.</li>

    <li>We utilize streaming video optimization technology in our network on qualifying Rate Plans to help minimize data consumption while also improving the service experience for all customers. Some Rate Plans have video optimization via the Binge On feature. Some qualifying video providers may choose to opt-out of the Binge On program. For a list of opt-out providers visit <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html#">http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html#</a>. The Binge On optimization technology is not applied to the video services of these providers; video from these services will stream at native resolution, and high-speed data consumption will continue as if Binge On were not enabled.</li>

    <li>Additionally, we may implement other network practices, such as caching less data.</li>

    <li>Our <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="http://www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet" target="_blank">Open Internet Policy</a> includes important information on these topics as well as information on commercial terms, performance characteristics (such as expected speed, latency) and network practices.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>*WHAT ARE THE PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED USES FOR MY DEVICE AND THE SERVICE?</strong></p>

<p>Our wireless network is a shared resource, which we manage for the benefit of all of our customers. Your Data Plan is intended for Web browsing, messaging, and similar activities. Certain activities and uses of our Services and your Device are permitted and others are not. For examples of permitted and prohibited uses, <a href="#EPPUSYD">click here</a>. If you buy, lease, or finance a Device manufactured for use on our network, you agree, and we rely on your agreement, that you intend it to be activated on our Service and will not resell or modify the Device, or assist anyone doing so.</p>

<p><strong>*WHAT HAPPENS IF MY DEVICE IS LOST OR STOLEN?</strong></p>

<p>You agree to notify us if your Device is lost or stolen. Once you notify us, we will suspend your Service. <a href="#Lost or Stolen">Click here</a> to learn more about how we handle Charges that are incurred after you report that your Device is lost or stolen.</p>

<p><a id="internationalServices" name="internationalServices"></a><a id="internationalLongDistance" name="internationalLongDistance"></a><a id="internationalLongDistanceTextPictureVide" name="internationalLongDistanceTextPictureVide"></a><a id="internationalRoaming" name="internationalRoaming"></a><a id="internationalData" name="internationalData"></a><a id="dataGlobalAddOnsAndGlobalMessagingPlans" name="dataGlobalAddOnsAndGlobalMessagingPlans"></a><a id="cruiseShipRoaming" name="cruiseShipRoaming"></a><a id="internationalMiscellaneous" name="internationalMiscellaneous"></a><strong>*HOW WILL I BE BILLED FOR USE OF THE SERVICES?</strong></p>

<p>You agree to pay all Charges we assess and bill you or that were accepted or processed through all Devices on your account. You may have to pay extra for calls to some numbers (e.g., conference & chat lines, broadcast, international, 900 or 976 calls, etc.). You agree to provide us with accurate and complete billing and tax related information and to report all changes within 30 days of the change. You will receive an electronic (paperless) bill unless you tell us you want a paper bill. You have the option of switching to a paper bill at no cost to you by changing your billing preferences at my t-mobile or by contacting Customer Care. For more information about paperless billing, please visit <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="http://www.t-mobile.com/billterms" target="_blank">www.t-mobile.com/billterms</a>.</p>

<p>Your Device can be used to purchase services and products from third parties, and Charges for these purchases may be included on your T-Mobile bill. For no additional cost you can block third party charges from being included on your T-Mobile bill by logging into your account at www.my.t-mobile.com or calling Customer Care. For more information about billing, <a href="#Billing Information">click here</a>.</p>

<p><a id="textInstantMsgPicVidMsg" name="textInstantMsgPicVidMsg"></a><strong>WHAT IF I DON&#146;T PAY ON TIME?</strong></p>

<p>We may charge a late fee of the greater of 1.5% per month (18% annually) or $5 per month and a returned payment fee up to $35, subject to the maximum allowed by law. We may use a collection agency to collect past due balances and you agree to pay collection agency fees. If we accept late or partial payments, you still must pay us the full amount you owe, including late fees. We will not honor limiting notations you make on or with your checks. Late payment, non-payment or collection agency fees are liquidated damages intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of our costs resulting from late payments and non-payments by our customers; these costs are not readily ascertainable and are difficult to predict or calculate at the time that these fees are set.</p>

<p><strong>*DOES T-MOBILE CHECK MY CREDIT?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, for many of our products and services. We may get information about your credit history from credit-reporting agencies, which may affect your credit rating. We may also report your payment record to credit-reporting agencies.</p>

<p><strong>AM I REQUIRED TO MAKE A DEPOSIT?</strong></p>

<p>We may require you to make a deposit or prepayment for Services. We can apply deposits, payments, or prepayments in any order to any amounts you owe us on any account. This deposit is refundable, and will be applied as a credit to your account along with interest as may be required by law.</p>

<p><strong>CAN T-MOBILE ACCESS MY DEVICE?</strong></p>

<p>We may remotely change software, systems, applications, features or programming on your Device without notice. These changes will modify your Device and may affect or erase data you have stored on your Device, the way you have programmed your Device, or the way you use your Device. You will not be able to use your Device during the installation of the changes, even for emergencies.</p>

<p><strong>CAN I DOWNLOAD AND USE THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND APPS ON MY DEVICE?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. You are free to download and use content or applications (&#147;Content &amp; Apps&#148;) on your Device that are not provided by T-Mobile, at your own risk. Third party Content &amp; Apps may require your agreement to a license or other terms with the third party. Some Devices or Content &amp; Apps may contact our network without your knowledge, which may result in additional Charges (e.g., while roaming internationally).</p>

<p><strong>*LICENSE</strong></p>

<p>Your Device&#146;s Software is licensed, not sold, to you by T-Mobile and/or other licensors for your personal, lawful, non-commercial use on your Device only. You may only use the Software as authorized by its license. Your Device&#146;s &#147;Software&#148; includes its software, interfaces, documentation, data, and Content &amp; Apps, as each may be updated or replaced by feature enhancements or other updates. For additional information regarding these license terms, including restrictions on your use of the Software, please <a href="#License">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>*WHAT IS THE TERM OF THESE T&amp;Cs?</strong></p>

<p>As the Un-Carrier, we did away with annual service contracts. You are free to go, although we’d be sad to see you leave. You are responsible for all Charges incurred through the end of your Service term. If you port your number to another carrier, your Service will be deactivated. In addition, cancellation of Service may affect other agreements that you have with us, including equipment installment plans or lease agreements where some of your payments may be accelerated upon cancellation.</p>

<p><strong>CAN T-MOBILE CHANGE OR TERMINATE MY SERVICES OR THIS AGREEMENT?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Except as described below for Rate Plans with the price-lock guarantee (including the “Un-Contract Promise”), we may change, limit, suspend or terminate your Service or this Agreement at any time, including if you engage in any of the prohibited uses described <a href="#EPPUSYD">here</a> or no longer reside in a T-Mobile-owned network coverage area. Under certain limited circumstances, we may also block your device from working on our network. If the change to your Service or Rate Plan will have a material adverse effect on you, we will provide 14 days’ notice of the change. You’ll agree to any change by using your Service after the effectiveness of the change. We may exclude certain types of calls, messages or sessions (e.g. conference and chat lines, broadcast, international, 900 or 976 calls, etc.), in our sole discretion, without further notice.</p>

<p>If you are on a price-lock guaranteed Rate Plan, we will not increase your monthly recurring Service charge (“Recurring Charge”) for the period that applies to your Rate Plan, or, if no specific period applies, for as long as you continuously remain a customer in good standing on a qualifying Rate Plan.  If you switch plans, the price-lock guarantee for your new Rate Plan will apply (if there is one). The price-lock guarantee is limited to your Recurring Charge and does not include, for example, add-on features, taxes, surcharges, fees, or charges for extra features or Devices. If your Service or account is limited, suspended or terminated and then reinstated, you may be charged a reactivation fee. For information about our unlocking policy, <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="http://www.t-mobile.com/Company/CompanyInfo.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_CompanySimUnlockPolicy&amp;link=unav" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>*YOUR CONSENT TO BE CONTACTED</strong></p>

<p>We may contact you without charge, on any wireless telephone number assigned to your account for any purpose, including marketing messages, and in any manner permitted by law. You also expressly consent to be contacted by us, and anyone contacting you on our behalf, for any purpose, including billing, collection, or other account or service related purpose, at any telephone number or physical or electronic address where you may be reached, including any wireless telephone number. You agree that T-Mobile, and anyone contacting you on our behalf, may communicate with you in any manner, including using a pre-recorded or artificial voice, or using an automatic telephone dialing system to place calls or send messages, alerts, or an automatic e-mail system to deliver email messages. If a contact number you have provided to us is no longer your number, you agree to notify us promptly that you can no longer be reached at that number. You represent that you have received, and are authorized to convey to us, the consent of any authorized users on your account to be contacted by us as described in this Section. You agree that all consents provided in this Section will survive cancellation of your Service and account.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a id="Dispute Resolution" name="Dispute Resolution"></a><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p>

<p><strong>*HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH T-MOBILE?</strong></p>

<p><b>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. YOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT, OUR PRIVACY POLICY, OUR SERVICES, DEVICES OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.</b> This includes any claims against other parties relating to Services or Devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, dealers, authorized retailers, or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. You and we each also agree that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, not state law, apply and govern the enforceability of this dispute resolution provision (despite the general choice of law provision set forth below). THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the above, <strong>YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES <u>WITHIN 30 DAYS</u> FROM THE EARLIER OF THE DATE YOU PURCHASED A DEVICE FROM US OR THE DATE YOU ACTIVATED A NEW LINE OF SERVICE (the &#147;Opt Out Deadline&#148;)</strong>. You must opt out by the Opt Out Deadline for each line of Service. You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by calling 1-866-323-4405 or online at <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="http://www.T-Mobiledisputeresolution.com" target="_blank">www.T-Mobiledisputeresolution.com</a> <strong>Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.</strong></p>

<p>For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address provided in the “How Do We Send Notices to Each Other” Section below. You and we each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If you and we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration. You and we each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings</strong>. You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (see the &#147;How Do We Send Notices to Each Other&#148; section below) to begin arbitration. The arbitration of all disputes will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration of all disputes will be conducted by a single arbitrator, who shall be selected using the following procedure: (a) the AAA will send the parties a list of five candidates; (b) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from that list, each party shall return its list to the AAA within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference; (c) AAA shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking; and (d) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the AAA may exercise its discretion in appointing the arbitrator. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay or reimburse all filing, administration and arbitrator fees. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys&#146; fees. In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not to seek an award of attorneys&#146; fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.</p>

<p><strong><u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</u></strong>. <strong>YOU AND</strong> <strong>WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION</strong>. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you. <strong>If you choose to pursue your claim in court by opting out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>JURY TRIAL WAIVER</u></strong>. If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, <strong>YOU AND</strong> <strong>WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</strong>.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a id="Additional Terms for Prepaid Customers" name="Additional Terms for Prepaid Customers"></a><strong>Additional Terms for Prepaid Customers</strong></p>

<p>Your T-Mobile prepaid Service account balance, if sufficient, or your active prepaid plan, gives you access to our prepaid Service for a limited amount of time; you must use your prepaid Service during the designated period of availability. To use our prepaid Service you must have a T-Mobile prepaid Service account balance for pay as you go service or be on an active prepaid plan. Service will be suspended when your account balance reaches zero and/or you are at the end of the time period associated with your prepaid plan. Monthly plan features are available for 30 days, however, depending on the time of day that you activate your Service or that your Service expires, your service cycle may not equal 30 full 24 hour days. Your monthly plan will automatically renew at the end of 30 days if you have a sufficient T-Mobile prepaid Service account balance to cover your prepaid Service plan before the first day after your service cycle. If you do not have a sufficient T-Mobile prepaid Service account balance, your prepaid Service will be suspended unless you move to a pay as you go plan. If you do not reinstate prepaid Service within the required period based upon your service plan, your phone number will be reallocated. The Charges for Service and the amount of time that Service is available following activation of your prepaid Service account balance may vary; see your Rate Plan for more information. Prepaid Service is non-refundable (even if returned during the Cancellation Period), and no refunds or other compensation will be given for unused airtime balances, lost or stolen prepaid cards, or coupons. You will not have access to detailed usage records or receive monthly bills. Coverage specific to our prepaid Service may be found at <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-coverage" target="_blank">http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-coverage</a> and differs from coverage related to our postpaid Service.</p>

<br clear="all" />

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a id="UsingOurNetwork" name="UsingOurNetwork"></a><strong>Using Our Network</strong></p>

<p><strong>WILL MY SERVICE VARY? WHAT FACTORS MAY AFFECT MY SERVICE?</strong></p>

<p>As our customer, your actual Service area, network availability, coverage and quality may vary based on a number of factors, including network capacity, terrain and weather. Outages and interruptions in Service may occur, and speed of Service varies. Devices also have varying speed capabilities and may connect to different networks depending on technology. Even within coverage areas and with broadband-capable devices, network changes, traffic volume, outages, technical limitations, signal strength, obstructions, weather, and other conditions may impact speeds and service availability.</p>

<p>We engineer our network to provide consistent high-speed data service, but at times and at locations where the number of customers using the network exceeds available network resources, customers will experience reduced data speeds. To provide the best possible on-device experience for the most possible customers on T-Mobile branded plans and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we may, without advance notice, take any actions necessary to manage our network on a content-agnostic basis, including prioritizing all on-device data over Smartphone Mobile HotSpot (tethering) data and further prioritizing the data usage of a small percentage of heavy data users, specifically those using more than 50GB of data in a billing cycle, below that of other customers in times and locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, for the remainder of the billing cycle. This threshold number is periodically evaluated and may change over time.</p>

<p>Where the network is lightly loaded in relation to available capacity, a customer whose data is prioritized below other data traffic will notice little, if any, effect from having lower priority. This will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations. At times and locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, these customers will likely see significant reductions in data speeds, especially if they are engaged in data-intensive activities. Customers on Rate Plans and Devices with 4G capability should be aware that these practices may occasionally result in speeds below those typically experienced on our 4G LTE and HSPA networks. We constantly work to improve network performance and capacity, but there are physical and technical limits on how much capacity is available, and in constrained locations the frequency of heavy loading in relation to available capacity may be greater than in other locations. When network loading goes down or the customer moves to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the customer&#146;s speeds will likely improve. See <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="http://www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet" target="_blank">www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet</a> for details.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a id="Roaming" name="Roaming"></a><strong>Roaming</strong></p>

<p><strong>*CAN I ROAM ON MY DEVICE?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Domestic</strong> <strong>Roaming:</strong> Your Device may connect to another provider&#146;s network (&#147;Off-Net&#148;). This may happen even when you are within the T-Mobile coverage area. Check your Device to determine if you are Off-Net. Please do not abuse this; we may limit or terminate your Service if you do.</p>

<p><strong>International Roaming &amp; Dialing:</strong> Availability and features offered for international roaming and dialing vary depending on your Rate Plan and Device. All countries may not be available for roaming and available countries may change from time to time; click <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/optional-services/roaming.html?icid=WMD_TM_INTRNTNLVR_N8J6LRGJILD2658" target="_blank">here</a> for more information about which countries are currently available for roaming. Whether roaming internationally or making and sending international calls and messages while in the U.S. (or Puerto Rico), you may be charged international rates (including for voicemails left for you and for data usage). This includes per minute rates for calls and per minute rates for calls transferred to your voicemail and the relevant data rates for data usage. You may be charged for more than one call for unanswered calls that are forwarded to voicemail regardless of whether the calls result in an actual voicemail message being left for you and regardless of whether your Device is on or off. Different rates and rounding increments apply in different countries. Click <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/optional-services/roaming.html" target="_blank">here</a> for information on international access, rates, Services and coverage. While roaming internationally, your data throughput may be reduced and your Service may be otherwise limited or terminated at any time without notice. You are responsible for complying with U.S. Export Control laws and regulations, and the import laws and regulations of foreign countries when traveling internationally with your Device.</p>

<br clear="all" />

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a id="Streaming Video" name="Streaming Video"></a><strong>Streaming Video</strong></p>

<p>We deploy streaming video optimization technology in our network as a feature on qualifying Rate Plans, which also helps to ensure that available network capacity can be utilized to provide a good service experience for the maximum number of customers. The optimization technology is intended to manage data usage on the network, reduce the risk of streaming video stalling and buffering on mobile devices, and reduce the amount of data consumed for streaming video, making room for other users to enjoy higher speeds and a better network experience overall. Video optimization occurs only to data streams that are identified by our packet-core network as video. While many changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on a user’s Device. Customers may choose Rate Plans where this feature is always enabled (e.g., “T-Mobile ONE”), with the ability to add a feature disabling optimization to foster native-resolution video capability. Alternatively, customers may choose Rate Plans that offer video optimization as a customer-controlled feature (e.g., “Binge On”). When this feature is enabled, on-device video is typically delivered at DVD quality (up to 1.5 Mbps speeds, generally 480p or better).</p>

<p>Some qualifying video providers may choose to opt-out of the Binge On program, see listing at <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html#" target="_blank">http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html#</a>. The Binge On optimization technology is not applied to the video services of these providers; video from these services will stream at native resolution, and high-speed data consumption will continue as if Binge On were not enabled. Rate Plans that feature this technology allow customers to choose to enable (and disable) video streaming optimization when connected to the cellular network, unless a provider has chosen to opt-out, see listing at <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html#" target="_blank">http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html#</a>.</p>

<p>Once you notify us that your Device has been lost or stolen, we will suspend your Service and you will not be responsible for additional usage charges incurred in excess of your Rate Plan Charges, applicable taxes, fees, and surcharges. If Charges are incurred before you notify us, you are not liable for Charges you did not authorize. However, the fact that your Device or account was used is some evidence of authorization. You may request us to investigate Charges you believe were unauthorized. We may ask you to provide information and you may submit information to support your request. If we determine the Charges were unauthorized, we will credit your account. If we determine the Charges were authorized, we will inform you within 30 days and you will remain responsible for the Charges. If you request that we not suspend your Service, you will remain responsible for all Charges incurred. We may prevent a lost or stolen Device from registering on our and other networks.</p>

<br clear="all" />

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a id="Billing Information" name="Billing Information"></a><strong>Billing Information</strong></p>

<p>Please read the following for more information about how we bill for calls, data usage and messaging, Wi-Fi usage, third party charges, taxes, and surcharges.</p>

<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Airtime usage is measured from the time the network begins to process a call (before the phone rings or the call is answered) through its termination of the call (after you hang up). For voice calls, we round up any fraction of a minute to the next full minute. Depending upon your Rate Plan, data usage may be rounded at the end of each data session, at the end of your billing cycle, and/or at the time you switch data plans. You may be charged for more than one call/message when you use certain features resulting in multiple inbound or outbound calls/messages (such as call forwarding, call waiting, voicemail, conference calling, and multi-party messaging). You will be charged for text, instant or picture messages, and email whether read or unread, sent or received, solicited or unsolicited. We use filters to block spam messages, but we do not guarantee that you will not receive spam or other unsolicited messages. Additional blocking options are available at <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="http://www.my.t-mobile.com/" target="_blank">www.my.T-Mobile.com</a>. Most usage and Charges incurred during a billing cycle will be included in your bill for that cycle. Some usage and Charges may be delayed to a later billing cycle, which may cause you to exceed Rate Plan allotments in a later billing cycle. Unused Rate Plan allotments expire at the end of your billing cycle. You may be billed additional Charges for certain features and services. Charges for Wi-Fi usage may differ; see your Rate Plan for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Taxes:</strong> You agree to pay all taxes and fees imposed by governments or governmental entities. We may not give advance notice of changes to these charges. To determine taxes &amp; fees, we use the street address you identified as your Place of Primary Use (&#147;PPU&#148;). The PPU for <strong>Puerto Rico customers</strong> must be in Puerto Rico. If you did not identify the correct PPU, or if you provided an address, such as a PO Box, that is not a recognized street address, does not allow us to identify the applicable taxing jurisdiction(s) or does not reflect the Service area associated with your telephone number, you may be assigned a default location for tax purposes. Except as may be otherwise required by law, in the event you dispute your PPU or the location we assigned you and the resulting taxes or fees applied on your bill, you must request a refund of the disputed tax or fee within 60 days of the date of our bill containing such tax or fee. Regardless of any Rate Plan guarantee, taxes and fees may change from time to time without notice.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Surcharges</strong>: If you are not on an all-inclusive Rate Plan, you agree to pay all surcharges. Surcharges are not mandated or imposed on you by law, they are T-Mobile Charges that are determined, collected and retained by us. The components and amounts of the Surcharges are subject to change without notice. Surcharges include charges, costs, fees and certain taxes that we incur to provide Services (and are not government taxes or fees imposed directly on our customers). Examples include general and administrative fees (such as certain costs we incur to provide Service) as well as governmental-related assessments (such as Federal or State Universal Service fees, regulatory or public safety charges, environmental fees, and gross receipts taxes). Surcharges assessed to you will vary depending on the type of Service and the Rate Plan you have. Surcharges will apply whether or not you benefit from the programs, activities or services included in the Surcharge. When Surcharges are assessed in connection with your Service, you can find the Surcharges detailed in either the &#147;Taxes, Fees &amp; Surcharges&#148;, &#147;T-Mobile Fees and Charges&#148; or the &#147;Other Charges&#148; sections of your bill or at your MyT-Mobile.com account. Regardless of any Rate Plan guarantee, Surcharges may change from time to time without notice.
