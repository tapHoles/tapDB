When you register for one of our Services, the information you provide may be added to a centralized Meredith database so that you may be simultaneously registered for our other Services as well. In addition, when you use various aspects of our Services, we may ask you for personally identifying information, including when you order magazines or other products, complete a survey, enter a contest, or report a problem with our Services. We may also collect contact information for other individuals when you use the sharing and referral tools available within some of our Services to forward content or offers to your friends and associates.

When your browser downloads a web beacon, the server that sends the corresponding image to your browser can recognize and store certain types of information such as cookies previously set, the time and date that you viewed the page embedded with the beacon and a description of that page.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information.</h3><p>Certain mobile devices, including smart phones and tablet devices, contain unique device IDs that can be used to identify their physical location. Some mobile device IDs are persistent, while others may be resettable by accessing the device&rsquo;s privacy settings. Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data (which may include a phone number) when used to transmit a telephone call or text message. When you use mobile devices to access our Services, we may collect and transmit unique device IDs and collect caller ID data, as well as other information about your device, including without limitation, your wireless carrier, the make, model, operating system, capacity and settings of your device, the names, package IDs and versions of other software you have downloaded to your device and information about how you interact with and navigate within our Service. With your consent, we or our authorized service providers and partners also may use precise geolocation technology such as GPS or Wi-Fi triangulation or mobile Bluetooth beacon technology to collect information about the exact location of your mobile device. Precise location information may be collected both while you are using one of our mobile applications and continuously over time while our apps are not in use but are running in the background of your device. This information may be used for the purposes described below in <a href="#header-usage">&quot;How We Use The Information We Collect,&quot;</a> including to tailor special offers and advertising to your interests, both in our Services, and in third-party marketing channels. You can withdraw your consent to the further collection and use of your precise device location data through any of our mobile apps by accessing your device&rsquo;s privacy settings as further explained below in <a href="#preciselocationoptout">&quot;Opt-out Choices: Precise Device Location Tracking.&quot;</a> For information about how to reset your advertising identifier and your other opt-out choices relating to interest-based advertising in mobile applications, see <a href="#mobileAppAd">&quot;Opt-out Choices: Mobile App Advertising and Tracking.&quot;</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Social Network Posting Tools and &quot;Share&quot; Features.</h3><p>You can access various social network posting and sharing tools through our Services that are operated by third parties, including a &quot;share&quot; button that allows you to post links to content and features that you believe will be of interest to others on your social network pages. When you visit a page that includes one of these sharing tools, the third-party company that operates the tool may be collecting information about your browser, device and online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own separate privacy policy, which may differ from ours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Nielsen Online Campaign Ratings Service.</h3><p>Some of our advertisers may participate in a program operated by the Nielsen Company to develop an Online Campaign Ratings service that is comparable to Nielsen&#39;s television ratings. When one of their ads appears on our Services, it may contain a web beacon that will record your exposure to the ad, read certain cookies on your browser, and forward this information to one or more operators of third-party websites or other online service on which you may have registered. If the third-party operator recognizes a cookie that identifies you as one of its registered users, it will append the impression data it receives, which may identify you as a user our Services, with age and gender information before returning the data to Nielsen. Nielsen aggregates the data it receives about a given campaign to create ratings reports for advertisers and publishers. According to Nielsen, these reports measure campaign performance on an aggregate level within various demographic categories and do not identify you personally.

The following describes some of the circumstances in which we may share information about our users:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Email.</h3><p>We share our users&#39; email addresses with service providers that send email messages and deliver targeted advertising on our behalf. These service providers may collect data about how you interact with those messages (including information about whether and when you opened a particular message or clicked on a link within a message and the device you used to do so) and analyze it in conjunction with similar information they collect when you respond to emails they send on behalf of their other clients who are not affiliated with us. They use this email response information in combination with your email address to target and optimize the delivery of emails and email advertising they send on our behalf and for their other clients. We may also provide our service providers with lists of our user email addresses in a hashed, encrypted or anonymized form that they use to recognize our users as they navigate online or use third-party email services and enable the delivery of interest-based advertising to those users. We do not authorize our service providers to share your email address with their other clients.</p><p>If you use our Services to sign up for special email offers from third-party advertisers, we will also share your email address and any other information you provided with your request with the advertisers you selected. Except as described in this policy, we will not sell or rent your email address to unaffiliated third parties for their email marketing purposes, without your consent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Co-Registration Offers.</h3><p>If, during or immediately following registration, you choose to access offers for goods or services that are available from selected third-party companies (&ldquo;Co-Registration Vendors&rdquo;), we may make certain contact and demographic information you provide (e.g., name, age, and/or email address) available to these vendors with your consent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Provider Partners and Service Providers.</h3><p>To make your experience with our Services more useful and enjoyable, we may offer some features (such as social sharing tools and chat rooms) in conjunction with third-party providers (&quot;Provider Partners&quot;) that specialize in operating such services. We share with each of these Provider Partners such information as is useful or necessary to provide you with the services we offer through that Provider Partner. Some of our Provider Partners may collect information directly from you pursuant to their own separate privacy policies which may differ from ours. For example, our affiliated company Meredith Performance Marketing, LLC operates the home contractor referral tools available through some of our sites and collects information through such features pursuant to its separate privacy policy available <a href="http://www.bhg.com/home-services/privacy_policy">here</a>. We also contract with other companies to provide specialized services to us, including but not limited to credit-card and billing processing, shipping, marketing, advertising optimization and interest-based targeting, email and text message distribution, data processing, mobile and website analytics, user authentication, security and promotions management. We reserve the right to share with these companies any information we collect about you and/or authorize them to collect information from you directly to support the services they provide to us. For example, some of our Services integrate with Google&rsquo;s reCAPTCHA widget to help us distinguish authentic human users from &ldquo;bots&rdquo; and protect our sites from spam and abuse. Through cookies and other tracking technologies, Google collects information about user activity to provide us with this service and processes and stores such information pursuant to its privacy policy available <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Aggregated and Anonymous Information.</h3><p>We and our service providers may combine information about you with information that we or they collect about other users of our Services and share it in a form that does not identify you personally. We and our service providers may also anonymize information by removing any information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifying to you.
