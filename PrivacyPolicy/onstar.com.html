You may cancel the Services at any time, as described in Section 6 below. Here are some highlights of Services that may be available to You:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Subscription</b>: Services may be offered to You for a monthly fee, such as the OnStar Security Plan or a Wi-Fi data plan;</li>
<li><b>Basic Plan and Trial Period</b>: Services may be available to You at no additional charge for a defined time period, such as a trial of the OnStar Guidance Plan or of a Wi-Fi data plan, or the OnStar Basic Plan. Following that defined period of time (e.g., the five years of OnStar Basic Plan) those Services will end unless we mutually agree to extend them;</li>
<li><b>Vehicle Health Monitoring</b>: Services may be available for your Vehicle that collect data from your Vehicle systems and provide You or your dealer with diagnostic and prognostic notifications, such as OnStar vehicle diagnostic services or vehicle health maintenance services that we may assist your Vehicle manufacturer in delivering to You. These Services do not report all conditions that may affect the operation of your Vehicle. For example, conditions occurring while your Vehicle is off or conditions that develop rapidly may not be reported using these Services;</li>
<li><b>Apps</b>: Services may be available to You that allow You to download or use applications through your Systems, including services offered through those applications and updates or upgrades to those applications and services (collectively referred to as “Apps”). An App may be offered by us or by third parties identified at the time You download or use the App. In addition to the terms of the Agreement, access and use of each App is subject to the End User License Agreement (the “<b>License</b>”) attached to these User Terms, and to any additional terms presented when You access or use the App. Please refer to each App for details on the specific features and services that are available through that App; and</li>
<li><b>Data Plan</b>: You may be offered data plans or other services from AT&amp;T or other Wireless Service Providers that can be used with the Connected Device in your Vehicle.

The AT&amp;T Terms apply solely to the AT&amp;T Services, and not to any other of the Services. In the event of a conflict between the AT&amp;T Terms and the terms of this paragraph, the preceding sentence will govern.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><b>Payment.</b> If You have a credit or debit card account or similar payment account on file with us (collectively, “<b>Payment Account</b>”), we will automatically charge it monthly according to the terms of your authorization if You have not otherwise pre-paid for Services You have requested. You may cancel your authorization at any time by pressing the blue OnStar button in your Vehicle or by calling us at 1-888-4-OnStar. Once You place your Payment Account on file with us, we may receive automatic updates of that account information from the financial institution for that account in order to keep that payment information current. Applicable fees for the Services, if any, must be paid in advance unless the Service offer expressly states otherwise. If You do not have a Payment Account on file with us You must provide us with payment monthly (or other payment period offered by us and chosen by You) in advance. The price of the Services may change over time, and we will charge the prices then in effect for the applicable payment period. You will be notified of any price increase applicable to Services You are paying for, so that You can cancel the Service if You do not wish to pay the higher price. <br />
The purchase or lease price of your Vehicle may have included a trial period for some of the Services, or we may otherwise offer You a trial period for some of the Services. If so, those Services will stop automatically without further notice at the end of the trial period, unless You elect to continue the Services and agree to pay the associated fees. If You elect to continue the Services and agree to pay the associated fees, we will automatically charge those fees to the payment method associated with your account according to the terms of your authorization.</li>
<li><b>Your Right to Cancel the Services at any Time.</b> This Agreement applies from the date of your acceptance until the Services are cancelled or terminated by You or us as permitted in this Agreement. You may cancel the Services at any time. To cancel the Services, You may call us at 1-888-4-OnStar or You may press the blue OnStar button in your Vehicle and inform the advisor that You want to cancel the Service. You must also contact us in this manner if You wish to sell or transfer your Vehicle.

Those Services are also subject to this Agreement. Your Fleet Company may also limit the types of Services that are available to You. The Services provided to a Fleet may be governed by additional terms and conditions and different privacy statements than those applicable to non-Fleet vehicles. Specifically, the Fleet Company may have requested additional data collection or handling practices that differ from those associated with certain Services.

<ol>
<li><b>Service Limitations.</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>15.1</b> The Services are only available in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Canada. The Services rely on wireless communication networks and the Global Positioning System (&quot;GPS&quot;) satellite network. NOT ALL SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE, PARTICULARLY IN REMOTE OR ENCLOSED AREAS, OR ON ALL VEHICLES, AT ALL TIMES. The area You are driving in may affect the Services that we can provide to You, including routing services.</p>
<p><b>15.2</b> The Services only work in places where we have retained a Wireless Service Provider for Service in that area and only if the Wireless Service Provider has technical compatibility with the Connected Device, coverage, network capacity, and reception when and where the Service is needed. Services that use location information about your Vehicle only work if GPS satellite signals are unobstructed, available in that place and compatible with your Vehicle systems.</p>
<p><b>15.3</b> YOUR VEHICLE MUST HAVE A WORKING ELECTRICAL SYSTEM (INCLUDING ADEQUATE BATTERY POWER) FOR THE SERVICES TO OPERATE.</p>
<p><b>15.4</b> The Services may not work if:</p>
<ul>
<li>equipment on your Vehicle is not properly installed;</li>
<li>You have not maintained the equipment or your Vehicle in good working order;</li>
<li>You do not comply with all applicable laws;</li>
<li>You try to add, connect or modify any equipment or software in your Vehicle (such as plugging devices into the Vehicle electrical system or diagnostic port);</li>
<li>your Vehicle is not compatible with the Services or the wireless service and technology provided by our Wireless Service Providers (this wireless service and technology is subject to change); or</li>
<li>other problems arise that we cannot control that interfere with the delivery or quality of the Services, such as hills, tall buildings, tunnels, weather, electrical system design and architecture of your Vehicle, damage to important parts of your Vehicle in an accident, or wireless phone network congestion or jamming.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>15.5 </b> We and the Wireless Service Providers are not responsible for any delay or failure in performance that (a) may have been prevented by You taking reasonable precautions or (b) is caused by acts of nature, or forces or causes beyond our reasonable control (for example: public utility electrical failure, acts of war, government actions, terrorism, civil disturbances, labor shortages or difficulties - regardless of cause-or equipment failures including Internet, computer, telecommunication or other equipment failures).</p>
<p><b>15.6</b> The routing data we provide is based on the most current map information available to us, but the information may be inaccurate or incomplete. For example, the route data may not include information about one-way roads, turn restrictions, construction projects, seasonal roads or new roads. The suggested route may use a road that is closed for construction or a turn that is prohibited by signs at the intersection. Suggested routes also do not consider whether the areas traveled are residential, commercial, or mixed and do not factor in the availability of public or private goods and services. Therefore, You should use good judgment, obey traffic and roadway laws and instructions and evaluate whether following the routing data provided through the Services is safe and legal based on the current conditions.</p>
<p><b>15.7</b> We recommend that You carefully read the applicable terms and policies that make up this Agreement, including our Privacy Statement, before using the Services.
