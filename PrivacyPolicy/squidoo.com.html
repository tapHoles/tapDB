<h2 id="content-ownership">6. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; CONTENT OWNERSHIP</h2>

<p>The Service and any software used in connection with the Service ("Software") contain proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws. Except as expressly authorized by HubPages or advertisers, You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on the Service or the Software, in whole or in part. In addition, the content, organization, graphics, design, compilation, magnetic translation, digital conversion and other matters related to the Service are protected under applicable copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary (including, but not limited to, intellectual property) rights. The copying, redistribution, use or publication by You of any such matters or any part of the Service, except as expressly allowed herein or via distribution tools HubPages makes available to Users, such as RSS feeds and widgets, is strictly prohibited. HubPages may at any point make additional software and tools available to Authors in connection with the Service ("Additional Software"). Authors who incorporate such Additional Software into their Hubs may have to agree to additional terms and conditions before using such software, and all rules and obligations outlined in these Terms apply to the ownership and use of such Additional Software.</p>

<p>HubPages does not claim ownership of Your Hub Content or Author Content. Such content will be owned by You or a third party from whom You got permission to post the content. By posting Hub Content on the Service, You grant HubPages a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license, for as long as Your Hub is displayed on HubPages and for a commercially reasonable time thereafter, to reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, modify, adapt and publish the Hub Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting Your Hub on or in connection with the Service. By posting Author Content on the Service, You grant HubPages a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, modify, adapt and publish the Author Content on or in connection with the Service. You may remove Your Hub Content from the Service at your discretion. You may not remove your Author Content from the Service. HubPages may preserve and store Hub Content (including, for a commercially reasonable time, Hub Content you have removed from the Service) or Author Content, and may disclose such content if required to do so by law or if HubPages believes in good faith that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (e.g., subpoenas); (b) enforce these Terms; (c) respond to claims that any Hub or Content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of HubPages, its users and the public.</p>

<p>The Author, and not HubPages, will be fully responsible for all Hub Content or Author Content that is uploaded, posted, transmitted or otherwise made available by the Author on the Service (collectively "User Content"). HubPages cannot guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of User Content. HubPages does not pre-screen User Content, but will have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or remove any User Content for any reason, including User Content that may violate these Terms, or that is otherwise objectionable. HubPages also cannot take responsibility for anything that Your Hub users may do in reliance on the Hub Content You post in Your Hubs.</p>

<h2 id="trademarks">7. TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS</h2>

<p>"HubPages," "HubScore," and "Hub" are HubPages service marks or trademarks and protected by applicable laws. Other product and company names mentioned on the Service may be the trademarks of their respective owners.</p>

<h2 id="links">8. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h2>

<p>Your Hub and the Service may include links to other sites or resources over which HubPages has no control or responsibility. HubPages does not monitor, investigate or check these sites for accuracy or completeness. As a result, HubPages is not responsible for the content or advertising on such sites, products or other materials which they may provide, such sites’ availability, or any damages caused or alleged to be caused in connection with such external websites. All such external websites included as links in Your Hub or accessed by You via the Service is done at Your own risk and with Your own liability.</p>

<p>HubPages may provide pre-built modules that make it easy for You to find and add links to various sites. However, just because HubPages provides these modules does not mean HubPages is responsible for their accuracy. The Author is still responsible for what links he or she elects to put in his or her Hubs or Author Content.</p>

<h2 id="earning">9. EARNING MONEY THROUGH HUBPAGES – AFFILIATE IDs PROGRAM AND HUBPAGES EARNING PROGRAM PARTICIPATION</h2>

<p>HubPages offers Authors the ability to share in Earning Page Views from third party websites by a variety of means:</p>

<h2 id="affiliate-ids">Assigning Affiliate IDs Program.</h2>

<p>Authors may assign an affiliate ID for third party accounts to their HubPages account (each an "ID"). For example, you can input your Google AdSense information into your HubPages account, and HubPages will share the Earning Ad Impressions with such services through that ID. You are solely responsible for verifying that you have entered a valid ID correctly.</p>

<a name="recent"></a><h2>RECENT CHANGES</h2>

<p>January 27, 2017: We removed the eBay Partner Network from the Terms of Use and it's no longer offered as part of the HubPages service.</p>
<p>February 2, 2016: We added websites to the service for where Hubs may appear when published.  Network sites include tatring.com, pethelpful.com and additional websites in the future.  Registration information is shared across all websites in the service.</p>

<p>September 8, 2015: We added information to section 9 covering the HubPages Earning Program and its subcomponents.  We amended the Affiliate IDs section and named it the Affiliate IDs Program which now includes a limitation on the number of display ads included in the program and allows HubPages to place additional ads on the Earning Page Views.  We added definitions for Earning Page View and Earning Ad Impression.</p>

<p>November 18, 2011: We have revised the terms to reflect our participation in the Amazon Associates Program.</p>

<p>October 4, 2011: We have generally revised the terms to reflect our participation in the eBay Partner Network.</p>

<p>August 9, 2011: We added a bullet regarding duplicate or similar content in section 4.</p>

<p>July 13, 2011: We added permitted uses and restrictions to user subdomains, since they were made available broadly to Authors today.</p>

<p>June 7, 2011: We removed references to the ad network Kontera, since we no longer provide support for it.</p>

<p>February 24, 2011: We added new information to Section 9 and Section 22 covering the HubPages Ad Program. We added a definition of Author Services and a reference to Author Services in Section 2. We updated Section 1 to reflect the current company name, HubPages, Inc.</p>

<p>September 20, 2010: We revised the definitions of Author Content and HubContent in Section 2, to make all photographs uploaded to the Service Author Content. (We did this because the technology we use to upload photos permits you to remove photographs from your gallery, but not from the Service itself.)</p>

<p>May 20, 2010: We clarified a restriction against spamming and promotion, and against using automated tools and services to create accounts and publish content.</p>

<p>March 8, 2010: We added notification in Section 15 of our and our authors’ participation in the Amazon Services LLC Associates program.</p>

<p>November 19, 2009: We made changes throughout the Terms. Please review the amended Terms carefully. Among other things, we clarified the licenses you grant to Hub Content and Author Content, changed the dispute resolution process, and added Sections 14, 15, 20, and 21.</p>
