<p>Please note that any video, image, or other content posted at the direction of users onto the 123Greetings website becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Non personally identifiable Information. 123Greetings may also collect or receive additional non-personally identifiable usage information specifically related to the use of a particular feature or offering on the Website, and responses to the offerings and advertisements presented on the Website. </p>
<p>123Greetings may also collect or receive (in some cases as part of the internet communication protocol) certain non-personally identifiable technical information, when the Website and pages are visited or when a 123Greetings client is used. </p>
<p><b>How is the information being used?</b><br />
<br />The information is used to operate and improve the features, offerings and content presented to you by 123Greetings, to personalize the content and advertisements provided to you; to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services; to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; to conduct research about your use of the Website; and to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest. </p>

However, while 123Greetings's business partners and advertisers may receive aggregate data about 123Greetings users, any personally identifiable information of yours will not be shared with third parties unless you have consented to the sharing of this information. </p>

<p><b>Cookies</b><br />
<br />123Greetings may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to enhance and personalize your experience of the Website, including to operate and improve offerings through the Website; to help authenticate your identity when you visit and transact with the Website; to remember your preferences and registration information; to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of the various offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which e-mails you open and act upon); and to customize the content and advertisements provided to you.   </p>

<p><b>What is 123Greetings.com's practice regarding IP addresses?</b><br />
<br />We collect and analyze traffic on our website by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally. However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message.</p>
<p>123Greetings.com includes the sender's IP Address in the source of each ecard HTML that is created at the website. This is available to the ecard recipient and anyone else who has access to the recipient's ecard. This limits your ability to communicate anonymously using ecards. Ecards are not intended for anonymous communications, and such activity is expressly prohibited by our Terms of Use. </p>
<p><b>What does 123Greetings.com do with the ecard messages &amp; information?</b><br />
<br />When you send one of our ecards, the information you provide to us is used to customize your greeting with the recipient's name and with your message, and to deliver an e-mail to the recipient. We treat our ecards as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient and the contents will not be disclosed to anyone other than the intended recipient.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, we will not monitor or edit the contents of the online ecards you send. Occasion, however, we may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your ecard or the maintenance of our network. Also, if you ask one of our customer service representatives to help you send an ecard or to verify that an ecard was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the ecard, including the recipient's e-mail address and the message. </p>
<p>If we have reason to believe, that an ecard has been sent using a false e-mail address or attempt to pose as someone else sending an ecard, information about you - including your computer's IP address - may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.</p>
<p><b>Third Party Ad Advertising </b><br />
<br />123Greetings or its advertisers may use third party ad networks and ad serving companies to help sell and present advertisements online in connection with the Website. These third party ad companies may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness and to compile anonymous statistics about 123Greetings users. The use of these technologies by these third party ad companies is subject to their own privacy policies, not 123Greetings's. These third party ad companies may also monitor 123Greetings for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisements, "click-throughs" and/or other activities. </p>
<p>123Greetings does not provide advertisers access to any personally identifiable information that you have provided to 123Greetings (keeping in mind that anything you have elected to share publicly on the site is available to everyone to see). </p>
<p><b>Security</b><br />
<br />123Greetings has implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect and safeguard the personally identifiable information under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss. All our personnel that have access to, and are associated with the processing of your personally identifiable information, are obligated to respect the confidentiality of the information. </p>
<p>123Greetings's Privacy Policy is to share personal information only with the owner's informed consent.

<p><b>Special Note for Parents</b><br />
<br />Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, 123Greetings does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information on the Website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our Website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Website at any time or in any manner. If 123Greetings learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Website without verified parental consent, then 123Greetings will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. </p>

<br />Please note that deletion of your personally identifiable information from 123Greetings's database will not prevent 123Greetings from using gathered anonymous information. </p>
<p><b>Third Parties' Practices:</b> This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices exercised by other providers of products or services, advertisers or other web sites, or companies/people that 123Greetings does not own or control, or does not employ or manage.</p>
<p><b>Non-U.S. Users:</b> The Website is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Website from a jurisdiction with privacy laws or regulations that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Website, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>
