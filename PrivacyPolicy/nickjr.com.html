  <p class="justify">We may request or
  collect certain information when you visit the Nickelodeon Sites. However, visitors are
  required to share only the information that is reasonably necessary to participate in
  the particular activity.</p>

  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em"><a class="no-hover" id="I_A"><strong> A.&nbsp;
  Registration Information</strong></a>:&nbsp; The information required to register varies by
  Site, but may include: (a) birth date; (b) gender; (c) country; (d) state; (e) zip
  code; (f) user name and password; (g) wireless telephone number; (h) email address; and
  (i) other profile information such as avatar preferences, communications preferences,
  and interests. If the Site either is directed to children under 13 or has actual
  knowledge that a user is under 13 years old, the child may be asked to provide his or her
  parent's or guardian's email address. For certain countries, visitors or their parents/guardians
  will receive an activation email and must follow the procedures or otherwise agree to
  the terms within the activation email within a certain time period to activate the
  account; accounts not activated within that time period will be deleted.</p>
  <p class="justify">Registration information
  is used to enable visitors to log into their accounts  across different devices and platforms; take advantage of site offerings; respond to
  visitor&#8217;s requests for products, services, and information; send communications to  users in connection with their account; manage games; serve
  appropriate material; customize the content you see when you visit the Nickelodeon
  Sites; and offer visitors special offers and promotions from Nickelodeon Sites and the
  &#8220;Viacom family of companies&#8221; (which comprises Viacom International Inc. and
  its subsidiaries and affiliates), as well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services, that we believe may be of interest to you.
</p>

<p class="justify">Certain non-child-directed Sites may offer visitors opportunities to apply for certain programs or other employment, training or internship opportunities. In order to submit an application for any one of these opportunities, the applicant may be required to supply other pertinent personal information including, without limitation, full name, postal address, telephone number(s) and email address.  Additional personal information and other information may be requested during the application process (but may not be required).  Such submissions are also subject to the policies regarding such respective programs.
</p>

  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em"><a class="no-hover" id="I_B"><strong>B. Social Platform
  Registrations and Social Media Plugins</strong></a>: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites permit or
  require users who are at least 13 years old to register or log into their account via a social networking platform such
  as Login with Facebook or Flux, or permit you to use social media plugins such as the
  Facebook &#8220;Like&#8221; or Google &#8220;+1&#8221; buttons. When you use these
  social networking platforms and plugins, your username and password for the services
  and other information available about you or collected from you on these services may
  be shared with us.</p>
  <p class="justify">When you use social
  networking platforms and plugins, you share your information with them and their
  privacy policy applies to their collection, use, and disclosure of such information. In
  addition, they may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on
  the Nickelodeon Sites, and they may notify your connections on the social networking
  platform about your use of the Nickelodeon Sites. Such services may also employ unique
  identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for
  purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you. For more information about logging into Facebook, please go <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/292105707596942/" target="_blank" class="no-adfree">here</a>. For more information on Flux, please go

  their privacy policies may be different from our own and we encourage you to read them.
</p>

  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em"><a class="no-hover" id="I_C"><strong>C.&nbsp;Computer
  Information Collected by Us</strong></a>:&nbsp; When visitors come to a Site, we may automatically
  collect certain information from their computers or mobile devices, such as the type of
  computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the visitor's IP address, the
  web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox), UDID (for certain mobile
  devices), information about the websites visited before and after visiting the Site,
  the web pages and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within the Nickelodeon
  Sites, interactions with e-mail messages sent by a Site or the Viacom family of
  companies (<em>e.g.</em>, links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or
  forwarded), information collected through the use of unique identifiers such as cookies
  (see below), information regarding the Internet service provider, and other standard
  server log information ("Computer Information").</p>
  <p class="justify">We may use cookies, web
  beacons, tokens or similar technologies (collectively referred to as &#8220;Tracking
  Technologies&#8221;) on the Nickelodeon Sites. "Cookies" (which may be html files,
  Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and
  activity.&nbsp;&#8220;Web beacons&#8221; (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs)
  are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views,
  promotion views or advertising responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Tokens&#8221; are unique 
  persistent identifiers that are generated and sent from a server, such as Adobe’s Pass 
  service, to a user’s device to identify an interaction session, such as the authentication 
  for a user’s cable provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie.  
  The Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies to collect Computer
  Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.</p>
  <p class="justify">We may use Tracking
  Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between certain
  Nickelodeon Sites without logging into each Site, enable the internal functioning of
  the Nickelodeon Sites, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the
  content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on the
  Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand
  your interactions with email messages originating from the Nickelodeon Sites or the
  Viacom family of companies (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were
  opened or forwarded), save your password, save your online game or video player
  settings, enable you to use shopping carts, help us offer you products, programs or
  services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and
  administer the&nbsp;Nickelodeon Sites.&nbsp; These Tracking Technologies collect
  &#8220;click stream&#8221; data and additional other information regarding your visits
  to the Nickelodeon Sites (such as your visits to specific webpages, use of features,
  purchasing history or preferences), may collect such other information across multiple
  sessions on the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites offered by the Viacom family of
  companies and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the
  device you use to access the site (&#8220;Identifier&#8221;). An Identifier may be
  automatically assigned to any device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites. When a 
  cable television service subscriber authenticates his cable television service to view 
  full episodes of Nickelodeon programing in the Nick mobile app, a third party token is 
  stored on the user’s mobile device so that the subscriber can view Nickelodeon television 
  episodes in the future without having to re-authenticate his cable service subscription.</p>
  <p class="justify">By visiting a Site,
  whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree
  that you are giving us your consent to set and access Cookies on  your device and track your activities and your use of a Site
  through these Tracking Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use Tracking
  Technologies in the emails we send to you.</p>
  <p class="justify">The Nickelodeon Sites
  adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. <a href=
  "http://srp.mtvn.com/sitefaq.html" target="_blank" class="no-adfree">Click here</a> for more information about the
  Nickelodeon Sites and online behavioral advertising. Nickelodeon does not behaviorally target 
  advertising to children under 13 on sites that are directed to children or where Nickelodeon 
has actual knowledge that a user is under 13.</p>
  <p class="justify">Our Third Party
  Advertising Service Providers (as defined in Section D) do not have access to Tracking
  Technologies set by the Nickelodeon Sites except to the extent necessary to provide
  services to the Site. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as
  advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your
  Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for
  Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to
  other information about you.</p>

Nickelodeon Sites use a variety of third-party

  advertisements based on your visits to the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites you
  have visited and may include delivering advertisements or other content for products

  seeing repeated advertisements and enable us to research the usefulness of certain
  advertisements. See <a href="#NM" class="no-adfree">here</a> for more information on this Site's use of Nielsen's proprietary measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information. Nickelodeon does not behaviorally target advertising to children under

<p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.  Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</p>  

<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.  Instead, as set forth above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described above in Section I(C).

  Electronic Postcards and Messages</strong></a>: Some Nickelodeon Sites provide visitors the

  want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the visitor&#8217;s behalf,
  email messages to family and/or friends. To do so, visitors must provide the email
  address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. Visitors must only provide  email addresses of people who they know would be happy to receive such  electronic postcards or email messages. Email
  addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the requested

  Nickelodeon Sites that are directed to children under 13  ask to receive our email
  newsletter(s), they&nbsp;will be asked to provide their first name, email address and

  notification email informing them of the child's request to receive by email the
  newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent/guardian the option to have his or
  her child's information removed from our newsletter database. The link to remove the
  child&#8217;s information will expire approximately 48 hours from the time it is sent,
  but at any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent/guardian
  may request that we stop sending the child the newsletter(s) by following the
  "unsubscribe" instructions found at the end of any of the newsletter emails.&nbsp;
  Parents/guardians may at any time review any personally identifiable information
  collected online about their child. See section V(B) below. When a child provides a
  parent's/guardian's email address when signing up for newsletter(s), that email address

  greeting card company, software manufacturer, social media plugin provider, mobile
  phone provider or cable television service provider to offer you electronic cards, games, social networking, text
  messaging services or customized video content. These partners operate websites and services that are separate and
  independent from the Nickelodeon Sites and, accordingly, may have their own privacy
  policies.&nbsp; If you consent or register with one of our partners, that means you
  grant the Nickelodeon Sites permission to give your registration and other information,
  including e-mail address, to that third party.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have identified
  yourself as residing in the EU, we will not share your email address or other
  personally identifiable information with third parties for advertising purposes unless you have
"opted-in."</p>

  <p class="justify">In addition, Third Party
  Advertising Service Providers may use their own Tracking Technologies to gather
  information about you. Please see Section I(D) above for more detailed information

  Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner's website. We may share your information with our
  Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service
  or feature means that you opt-in and affirmatively consent to both the Nickelodeon
  Sites and our Co-Branded Partner collecting and using the information you provided
  during registration and/or in connection with the specific co-branded feature for
  fulfillment, marketing or administrative purposes. If you wish to opt-out of a
