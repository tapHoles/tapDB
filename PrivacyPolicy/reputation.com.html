<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="p6"></a>9. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.</p>
<p>Reputation.com and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.</p>
<p>We partner with a third party to or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">here</a> or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://ww.youronlinechoices.eu">here</a>. In addition, we partner with a third party advertising provider AdRoll. To opt out of receiving any advertsing from AdRoll, please opt out <a href="https://app.adroll.com/optout/safari">here</a>. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
</li>
<li>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user&#8217;s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Site.</li>
<li>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. Specifically, we use session cookies to track your session ID and to track whether or not you are logged into the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser&#8217;s &#8220;help&#8221; file. Click <a href="http://www.proxyway.com/www/delete-computer-cookies.html">here</a> for more information on how to remove persistent cookies.</li>
<li>We set a persistent cookie to store how you came to the Site and what purchase packages and discounts we are able to offer you upon your registration. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Site.</li>
<li>You may adjust your browser settings to refuse or to remove or clear cookies by following the directions provided in your browser settings. If you reject cookies, you will still be able to view the Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site, will be limited. You will be unable to log into the Site if you reject cookies.</li>
<li>Some of our business partners (e.g., analytical tracking software providers) use cookies and tracking technologies on their sites. We have no access to or control over these cookies or tracking technologies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies on<a href="https://www.reputation.com/">www.reputation.com</a> and by Reputation.com Inc. only and does not cover the use of cookies or tracking technologies by any such business partner.</li>
<li>We employ, and our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to learn about the interactions of our users with the Site and our outbound emails. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user&#8217;s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers&#8217; personally identifiable information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</li>
