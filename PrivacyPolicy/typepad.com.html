<p>5.2 Typepad does not claim ownership over the Personal Information you post on or through Typepad's Sites, Services or Software. After posting your Personal Information, you continue to retain your ownership of your Personal Information and you continue to have the right to use and license your Personal Information in any way you choose. By using Typepad's Sites, Services and Software or by otherwise submitting your Personal Information to us, you are granting Typepad and third parties permission to use, distribute and, in some circumstances, to keep copies of your Personal Information as described in greater detail in this Privacy Policy. You may always decline to submit Personal Information to us, but please be aware that your decision may prevent you from being able to use all or portions of Typepad's Sites, Services and Software.</p>

<p>5.3 You hereby grant Typepad a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable and transferable right and license to use, reproduce, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display your Personal Information. This license ends when you delete your Personal Information or your account (except to the extent that your Personal Information has been shared with others or syndicated to third parties and they have not deleted it or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy).</p>

<p>5.4 Typepad is not responsible for how any third party uses, distributes or keeps your Personal Information. If you have any questions regarding how any third party uses, distributes or keeps your Personal Information or you wish to access, correct, amend or delete any of your Personal Information in the possession of that third party, you must contact that third party directly.</p>

<p>5.5 Typepad uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.</p>

<p>5.6 We do not share your information with unrelated third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, Typepad's Sites, Services and Software may display targeted advertisements based on Personal Information.</p>

<p>5.7 Typepad may use or share your Personal Information where it is necessary to complete a transaction, to operate or improve Typepad's Sites, Services and Software, to do something that you have asked us to do or tell you of products and services that we think may be of interest.</p>

<p>5.8 To receive optional email messages such as newsletters and marketing and promotional offers, you will be required to provide us with your email address. In addition to these optional email messages, Typepad may contact you via any email address you provide to us with transactional or relationship messages such as account status messages, security updates or notifications of changes in the terms of your account or the Services. These types of transactional or relationship email messages are not optional.</p>

<p>5.9 When you post a message, your user ID or alias that you are posting under may be visible to other users.</p>

<p>5.10 When you post a message on or through Typepad's Sites, Services and Software, you have the ability to post a message which may include Personal Information.

<p>5.11 If you post Personal Information online that is accessible to the public, please be aware that you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>

<p>5.12 Typepad may share personally identifiable information about you under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>In the course of operating our business, it may be necessary or appropriate for us to provide access to your Personal Information to others such as our service providers, contractors and select vendors so that we can operate Typepad's Sites, Services and Software and our business. Where practical, we seek to obtain confidentiality agreements that are consistent with this policy and that limit others' use or disclosure of the information you have shared.</p></li>

	<li><p>We may share your Personal Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims or in such circumstances where, in our judgment, disclosure is required or appropriate.</p></li>
	<li><p>We may share your Personal Information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our various terms of service or as otherwise required by law.</p></li>
	<li><p>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell all or part of our business. In such transactions, Personal Information collected from users is generally one of the business assets that will be transferred. The transferred Personal Information will remain subject to this Privacy Policy or subsequent policies to which you have consented.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>6. Advertising</p>

<p>6.1 We may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within Typepad's Sites, Services and Software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons. If you would like to contact the advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies with which we have relationships to learn more about their privacy policies and what options (if any) they offer to opt out of their data collection, please visit their web site(s). You may find a list of links to these companies' Web sites <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/advertising/solutions-for-bloggers/privacy/3rd-party-list/index.html">here</a>. Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p>6.2 We collect your interactions with advertising (such as click-throughs) displayed on or through Typepad's Sites, Services and Software and on those third party Web sites on which we display advertising. We use this information to evaluate and report on the success of the displayed advertising.</p>

<p>7. Information Relating to Children</p>

<p>7.1 We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 13 or knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to register for Typepad's Sites, Services and Software. If you are under 13, do not register or attempt to register for any of Typepad's Sites, Services and Software or send any information about yourself to us.

<p>7.2 If we learn that we have collected or been sent Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that Personal Information as soon as reasonably practical.

<p>9. Retention of Personal Information and Other Data</p>

<p>10. Confidentiality and Security</p>

<p>10.1 No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make efforts to ensure security on our systems:</p>

<ul>

	<li><p>We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information about you.</p></li>
	<li><p>Your account information is password-protected.</p></li>
	<li><p>In certain areas, Typepad's Sites, Services and Software use industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>10.2 If Typepad learns of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using Typepad's Sites, Services and Software or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of those Sites, Services and Software. We may post a notice on our applicable web sites if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the applicable web sites. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances.
