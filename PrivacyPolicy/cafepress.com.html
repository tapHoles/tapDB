It also precludes you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, or representative action against cafepress by someone else. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or from having a jury trial. Whether to agree to arbitration is an important decision. It is your decision to make and you should not rely solely on the information provided in this agreement, as it is not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of arbitration. You should take reasonable steps to conduct further research and to consult with an attorney regarding the consequences of your decision. You may opt-out of this arbitration provision by following the instructions below.</p>\n                <p><span class=\"bold\">Scope of Arbitration. </span>You and CafePress agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your access to or use of the Website, C&amp;B, or Services or to this Agreement or any other aspect of the parties’ relationship (a \"Dispute\"), shall be determined by arbitration, except that you and CafePress are NOT required to arbitrate any Dispute in which either party seeks equitable and/or legal or other relief for alleged violation of the Copyright Act, Lanham Act, or Patent Act or for state law claims of copyright, trademark, trade secret or unfair competition laws.</p>\n                <p><span class=\"bold\">Small Claims Court. </span>Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</p>\n                <p><span class=\"bold\">Applicable Arbitration Rules and Procedure. </span>The arbitration shall be governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules”), available at <a href=\"http://www.jamsadr.com\">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in this Arbitration Provision, except that JAMS may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this Arbitration Provision, the rules set forth in this Arbitration Provision shall govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.

For example, you cannot make merchandise depicting a musical group or artist simply because you run a fan-based website for that group or artist or just because you downloaded his/her/their image from an internet website. You also cannot modify the name of or other intellectual property relating to these individuals and avoid infringement.</li>\n                    <li>NO use of names, logos, pictures, or other intellectual property of sports teams, colleges/universities, clubs, or organizations. Modifications may not avoid infringement.</li>\n                    <li>NO photos, logos, caricatures, or other artwork depicting actors, actresses, models or other celebrities. Just because you take a photograph of a celebrity does not necessarily give you the right to use that photograph on merchandise, even if you digitally manipulate the photograph. However, Content depicting political figures is permissible if used to promote political free speech (and not to endorse products). A political figure is usually a person holding or seeking political office. While certain celebrities are sometimes active in politics, CafePress does not allow use of content depicting celebrities in any manner unless expressly authorized by that person.</li>\n                    <li>NO use of trademarks, names, or logos of companies. For example, you cannot use the name of a company or company logo. However, Content depicting political parties is permissible if used to promote political free speech, and the Content does not otherwise use or depict other trademarks, names, or logos.</li>\n                    <li>NO pictures or photographs of products (such as toys). Even if you own a product, intellectual property laws may still prohibit you from selling merchandise that features pictures of it. For example, you cannot take a picture of your famous doll and sell merchandise for that famous doll with that picture.</li>\n                </ul>\n                <p>This list is NOT comprehensive.

As a member of the Program, you may provide on your Affiliate Website one or more of the following types of links to the Website:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Product Links</li>\n                    <li>Category Links</li>\n                    <li>Search Box Links</li>\n                    <li>General Link to www.CafePress.com Home Page</li>\n                </ul>\n                <p>We will provide you with guidelines and graphical artwork to use in linking to the Website. To permit accurate tracking, reporting, and commission fee calculation, we will provide you with special \"tagged\" link formats to be used in all links between your Affiliate Website and the Website. You must ensure that each of these links properly utilizes such special link formats. Links to the Website placed on your Affiliate Website pursuant to this Agreement and which properly utilize such special link formats are referred to as \"Special Link(s).\" You will only earn commission fees with respect to activity on the Website occurring directly through Special Links. We will not be liable to you with respect to any failure by you to use Special Links, including to the extent that such failure may result in any reduction of amounts which would otherwise be paid to you pursuant to this Agreement. You will, however, earn commission fees with respect to all product purchases through the Website once from that \"Special\" link.</p>\n                <p>3.2 Additional Restrictions. (a) You may not use any existing or future software products or services that (1) will replace, intercept, interfere, hinder, disrupt or otherwise alter in any manner the Website user's access, view or usage of, or other aspect of the user's experience at any CafePress Affiliate Websites in a manner that causes or otherwise results in a different experience from what was otherwise intended by CafePress Affiliates; or (2) will block, alter, direct, redirect, substitute, insert, append itself to, or otherwise intercept or interfere in any manner with any click through or other traffic-based transaction that originated from CafePress Affiliates with the result of reducing any compensation or other payment earned by or owing to CafePress Affiliates. (b) You may not purchase, register, or bid on any keywords, search terms or other identifiers that include the term \"cafepress\" or variations thereof (for example \"cafepress\", \"cafe press\", \"CafePress.com\", etc.) for use in any search engine, portal, sponsored advertising service or other search or referral service.</p>\n                <p>If CafePress determines, in its sole discretion, that you have engaged in any of the foregoing activities, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to CafePress) withhold any referral fees otherwise payable to you under this Agreement and/or terminate this Agreement. (c ) If you are a CafePress Designer, you cannot earn commissions as an Affiliate by linking to your own CafePress Shops or Products. CafePress Designers can only earn commissions as an Affiliate by linking to the shops of other members or to the CafePress marketplace. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are abusing the system, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to us) withdraw your participation and withhold any commission fees payable to you through the Affiliate Program.</p>\n                <p>3.3 Responsibility for Your Affiliate Website. You will be solely responsible for the development, operation, and maintenance of your Website and for all materials that appear on your Affiliate Website. For example, you will be solely responsible for:</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>The operation of your Affiliate website</li>\n                    <li>Creating and posting any applicable Product descriptions on your Affiliate website and linking those descriptions to our catalog</li>\n                    <li>The accuracy and appropriateness of materials posted on your Affiliate website</li>\n                    <li>Ensuring that materials posted on your Affiliate website do not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third party</li>\n                    <li>Ensuring that materials posted on your Affiliate website are not libelous or otherwise illegal</li>\n                </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <span class=\"bold underline\">Customers Purchasing via the Program</span>\n                <p>4.1 Order Processing and Reporting. We will process Product orders placed by customers who follow Special Links from your Affiliate Website to the Website (\"Customers\"). We reserve the right to reject orders that do not comply with any requirements that we may periodically establish. We will be responsible for all aspects of order processing and fulfillment. Among other things, we will prepare order forms; process payments, cancellations, and returns; and handle Customer service. We will track sales made to Customers who purchase products using Special Links from your Affiliate Website to the Website and will make available to you reports summarizing this sales activity. The form, content, and frequency of the reports may vary from time to time at our discretion.</p>\n                <p>4.2 Policies and Pricing on the CafePress Website. Customers who buy products through this Program will be deemed to be our customers. Accordingly, all of our rules, policies, and operating procedures concerning customer orders, customer service, and product sales will apply to those Customers. We may change our rules, policies and operating procedures at any time. For example, we will determine the prices to be charged for any Products sold under this Program in accordance with our pricing policies. Product prices and availability may vary from time to time. Because price changes may affect products that you already have listed on your Affiliate Website, you may not include price information in your product descriptions. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to present accurate information, but we cannot guarantee the availability or price of any particular product.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <span class=\"bold underline\">Commissions</span>\n                <p>5.1 Commission Fees. We will pay you fees on certain Product sales to third parties. For a Product sale to be eligible to earn a fee, the Customer must follow a Special Link from your Affiliate Website to the Website, select and purchase the Product using our automated ordering system within sixty (60) days of the initial Customer session on the Website, accept delivery of the Product at the shipping destination, and remit full payment to us. Only if all of the above circumstances are met will you be eligible for a fee to be paid. Products that are eligible for earning fees in the Affiliate Program may change at any time with no notice to Affiliates.</p>\n                <p>5.2 Commission Fee Schedule. You will earn Affiliate commission fees based on \"Net Qualifying Revenues\" according to commission fee schedules established by us which as of today's date are as set forth below. \"Qualifying Revenues\" are base price revenues derived by us from our sale on our site of print-on-demand products such as apparel, prints or accessories. \"Net Qualifying Revenues\" do not include royalties, shipping &amp; handling, gift-wrapping, taxes, and service charges. We pay monthly commissions of fifteen percent (15%) to Affiliates. Net Qualifying Revenues may only be generated in the Marketplace portion of the Website and no such revenues may be earned from the Shops portion of our site. Designers on the Website are not eligible for Affiliate commissions under this Affiliate Program. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are in violation of any rule of this Affiliate Program or of abusing the system in the manner as determined in our sole discretion, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to us) withdraw your participation and withhold any commission fees payable to you for Affiliate Websites you recruit.</p>\n                <p>5.3 Commission Fee Payment. We will pay you commission fees on a monthly basis. Within sixty (60) days following the end of each calendar month, we will send you a check for the applicable commission fees earned on Net Qualifying Revenue generated during the applicable month, less any taxes on that Net Qualifying Revenue that we are required by law to withhold. However, if the commission fees payable to you for any month are less than $50, we will hold those commission fees until the total amount due is at least $50 or until this Agreement is terminated. If a Product that generated a commission fee is returned by the Customer, we will deduct the corresponding commission fee from your next monthly payment. If there is no subsequent payment, we will send you a bill for the commission fee.</p>\n                <p>5.4 Processing Fees. If CafePress owes you accrued compensation that is less than $25 for at least 365 days, then we may send you payment of such accrued compensation minus a $10 processing fee. If the amount of accrued compensation is under $10 for at least 365 days, such amount will be used to cover our administrative costs and no payment will be made to you.</p>\n                <p>5.5 Charitable Contribution. Unless we otherwise agree in writing, we may remit any payment otherwise due to you as a contribution in your name to a 501(c)(3) charitable nonprofit organization of our choice (or any charity agreed upon in writing by you and CafePress) if: you fail to provide us with accurate and complete contact information; and (ii) the funds remain outstanding for more than twelve (12) months. If we make such a contribution, our obligation to you shall be reduced by the amount of that contribution.</p>\n                <p>5.6 Termination Fees. If you or we terminate your Affiliate Account, and you have less than $25 in accrued but unpaid compensation then outstanding, CafePress may charge you a $10 processing fee when sending you your final payment to cover its administrative costs.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <span class=\"bold underline\">Identifying Yourself as an Affiliate</span>\n                <p>6.1 All other Communications. You may not make any press release with respect to this Agreement or your participation in the Program without our prior written consent, which may be given or withheld in our sole discretion. You may not misrepresent the nature of your or any other participant's participation in the Program, and doing so may result in suspension or termination from the Program.</p>\n                <p>6.2 Other Website Promotion. If you engage in any of the prohibited activities noted below, you will be subject to immediate termination from the Program. a) Anti-Spamming Policy. You may not use \"spam,\" \"blast-faxes\" or recorded telephone messages to market or sell Products.

As part of the Program, some members may choose to enable Customers to use selected images from their Affiliate Website, either owned by the member or licensed from a third party, for use with Products to be purchased by a Customer. If you choose to enable your Customers to use selected images from your Affiliate Website, either owned by you or licensed from a third party (\"Images\") to create and purchase Products, then you agree to abide by the following terms:</p>\n                <ol type=\"a\">\n                    <li>Prohibited Images: You may not design, manufacture, market or sell a Product that is generally offensive or inappropriate for use with the Program, as determined by CafePress in its sole and absolute discretion. Please refer to our Content Usage Policy for information about how CafePress exercises such discretion. For example, but without limitation, you may not design, manufacture, market or sell a Product that CafePress believes: infringes the rights of a third party, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and rights of privacy and publicity; (ii) is libelous, defamatory or slanderous; (iii) is obscene or pornographic; (iv) is designed to or does harass, threaten, or abuse others; or (v) violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation, including, without limitation, by exploiting images or the likeness of minors. While CafePress has no obligation to monitor the transactions or communications made through its Website, it reserves the right to cancel any such transaction or take any other action to restrict access to or the availability of any material that may be considered to be objectionable, without any liability to you or any third party.</li>\n                    <li>Limited License to Your Images: In making available any Images for upload to and use on the Website in connection with the Program, you grant to CafePress a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, nonexclusive, right and license in such Images, in all media existing now or created in the future, to do what it deems reasonable: to permit you to use the Designer Service to design, manufacture, market and sell Products and (ii) to promote, market and advertise your Products, your Shop, or the CafePress Service generally. Without limitation, this promotion, marketing, or advertising may consist of: display of your Products, (ii) promotional \"streams\" of audio Images on the Website, and (iii) display of pages from book Products on the Website. CafePress. may sublicense the rights that you grant it in this Section to a third party subcontractor only for purposes of manufacturing Products sold through your Shop.

Within thirty (30) days following termination of your Affiliate Account, CafePress will terminate its use of your Images.</li>\n                    <li>Ownership of And Use Rights to Your Images: You must have all necessary approvals and consents necessary for the use of the Images, and you must deliver copies of those approvals and consents to CafePress if CafePress requests them. In all events, you, and not CafePress, will be responsible for the payment of all royalties or similar payments that are or may become due to any third party, such as all payments under licenses for third-party material in the Images, in connection with the use of Images under this Program.</li>\n                </ol>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <span class=\"bold underline\">Fraud</span>\n                <p>Fraud; No Special Incentives. You may not participate in any scheme that would be deemed fraud, credit card fraud or an attempt to purchase Products from the Website with an intent to defraud, nor may you assist any third parties in doing so, whether successful in such efforts or not. You may not, directly or indirectly, offer any person or entity any consideration or incentive (including, without limitation, monetary payments or discounts) for using Special Links on your Affiliate Website to access the Website (e.g., by implementing any \"rewards\" program for persons or entities who use Special Links on your Affiliate Website to access the Website) for any reason, either to purchase Products, to become an Affiliate, or otherwise. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have offered any person or entity any such consideration or incentive, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to us) withhold any commission fees otherwise payable to you under this Agreement and/or terminate this Agreement.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <span class=\"bold underline\">Indemnification</span>\n                <p>As you are bound by the Terms of Service in participating in the Program, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless CafePress for any claim arising out of, relating to, or concerning your alleged breach of this Agreement, the Terms of Service in participating in the Program or any other agreement you may have with us.

            <li><span class=&quot;bold underline&quot;>Applicable law, Jurisdiction, and Venue: </span>This User Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, in accordance with the Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section of this Agreement set forth below in Section D. Any and all claims of infringement involving the Website, C&amp;amp;B, and/or the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable federal law, and shall be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. The parties acknowledge that this User Agreement is evidence of a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted under this User Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., §§ 1-16).</li>

            <li>
                <span class=&quot;bold underline&quot;>Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration:</span>
                <span class=&quot;bold uppercase&quot;>Please read this &quot;dispute resolution by binding arbitration&quot; provision carefully, because it requires you to arbitrate disputes with cafepress and it limits the manner in which you can seek relief.</span>
                <p class=&quot;uppercase&quot;>This provision precludes you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against cafepress. It also precludes you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, or representative action against cafepress by someone else. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or from having a jury trial. Whether to agree to arbitration is an important decision. It is your decision to make and you should not rely solely on the information provided in this agreement, as it is not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of arbitration. You should take reasonable steps to conduct further research and to consult with an attorney regarding the consequences of your decision. You may opt-out of this arbitration provision by following the instructions below.</p>
                <p><span class=&quot;bold&quot;>Scope of Arbitration. </span>You and CafePress agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your access to or use of the Website, C&amp;amp;B, or Services or to this Agreement or any other aspect of the parties’ relationship (a &quot;Dispute&quot;), shall be determined by arbitration, except that you and CafePress are NOT required to arbitrate any Dispute in which either party seeks equitable and/or legal or other relief for alleged violation of the Copyright Act, Lanham Act, or Patent Act or for state law claims of copyright, trademark, trade secret or unfair competition laws.</p>
                <p><span class=&quot;bold&quot;>Small Claims Court. </span>Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</p>
                <p><span class=&quot;bold&quot;>Applicable Arbitration Rules and Procedure. </span>The arbitration shall be governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules”), available at <a href=&quot;http://www.jamsadr.com&quot;>www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in this Arbitration Provision, except that JAMS may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this Arbitration Provision, the rules set forth in this Arbitration Provision shall govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in Jefferson County, Kentucky.</p>

                                <span>F 404-588-0905</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the address set forth above in Section A on Notices or in accordance with that Section.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Hearing Format. In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based. The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><span class=&quot;bold&quot;>Location of Arbitration and Applicable Rules.</span> You and CafePress agree that such arbitration shall occur in Jefferson County, Kentucky. You may request to appear in such proceedings telephonically.

                <p><span class=&quot;bold&quot;>Authority of Arbitrator.</span> With the exception of class procedures and remedies as discussed below under &quot;Waiver of Class Relief,&quot; the arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.</p>
                <p><span class=&quot;bold&quot;>Allocation of Arbitration Fees.</span> If you assert a Dispute as a consumer, you will only be required to pay arbitration fees of $250 of the fees charged by JAMS in connection with any arbitration under this section, and CafePress will bear all other costs charged by JAMS or the arbitrator, including any remaining JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator's services. You will still be responsible for paying your own attorneys’ fees.</p>
                <p class=&quot;bold uppercase&quot;>Waiver of class actions and class arbitrations. You and cafepress agree that each party may bring disputes against the other party only in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, including without limitation federal or state class actions, or class arbitrations. Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures outlined in this arbitration provision, an arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one party’s claims without the written consent of all parties to an arbitration proceeding.</p>
                <p><span class=&quot;bold&quot;>Procedure to Opt-Out of Arbitration Provision.</span> You may opt-out of this arbitration provision only by written Notice via U.S. Mail, or by any nationally recognized delivery service (e.g., UPS, Federal Express, etc.) to CafePress Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 11909 Shelbyville Road, Louisville, KY 40243. <span class=&quot;bold&quot;>You must send such Notice within thirty (30) days of your acceptance of this Agreement.</span> You must sign and date the Notice, and include in it your name, address, and a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with CafePress through arbitration.

                <p>If any portion of this Section entitled &quot;Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration&quot; is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of this Section remaining in full force and effect.

                    <li>For each of your Products sold through Shops, you pay us the Base Price plus any applicable Surcharges for our Services.

No transaction fee will apply to Retail Prices which are $15 or less over the Base Price. For example, if you markup an item by $20, we will charge you a transaction fee of $0.25 (5% of the $5 over the $15 markup limit).<br />Products sold through the Marketplace, the Services, Fan Portals or that include Branded Products are subject to a different pricing and royalty structure (See Fees and Royalties Chart), even where the product itself may be identical (e.g. you may have a product available in both your Shop and the CafePress Marketplace, if the Product is added to a cart from your Shop it will be subject to the Base Price/markup pricing structure noted here, whereas if the Product is added to a cart in the Marketplace it will be subject to the Marketplace pricing and Royalty structure).</li>

        <p>Products that you offer for sale through the Marketplace and Fan Portal portions of the Services are offered at preset retail prices determined by us and/or our partners.  These retail prices are based on a variety of factors including the cost of the blank product to be printed, as well as the costs of printing, shipping, and provision of the Services and/or partner services provided to you.  We do not take Content into consideration when setting retail prices for Products offered for sale through the Services, so pricing is completely independent of the Content involved. </p>
        <p>By using the Services, you understand that the blank products offered, and their associated retail prices, may change at any time and you agree to and accept any and all such changes.</p>
        <p>Finally, all Content offered for sale through the Services may be made available for purchase on third party websites.  Individual partners may establish and control their own retail prices, so they may differ from those on the Website.</p>

                    <li>is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable, generally offensive or in bad taste, as determined by CafePress; or</li>
                    <li>is otherwise prohibited by applicable law.</li>

                <p>The list above is <span class=&quot;bold&quot;>NOT</span> exhaustive, and only serves as a general guideline.</p>
                <p>AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT TOLERANCE IN A DIVERSE WORLD: CafePress has millions of users, from varied backgrounds and cultures, who differ in their beliefs and views about what is considered acceptable and what is considered offensive. We recognize that along with such diversity comes differences which may result in some individuals being offended by the opinions, perspectives and creative expressions of others within our user group. We ask that you exercise tolerance, and respect each individual's right to express him- or herself in a manner consistent with our CUP.</p>
                <p>All Content that you upload is automatically stored to the Website. We do not review any Content before you upload it to the Website. By using our Services, you assume full responsibility for all of the Content that you upload to the Website, and for complying with our CUP.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class=&quot;bold&quot;>Examples of Content Prohibited Under Intellectual Property Laws</span>
                <p>Following are some examples of Content that should not be uploaded to the Website under intellectual property laws:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NO unofficial merchandise, such as Content relating to professional sports teams, videogames, or Olympic merchandise.</li>
                    <li>NO use of names, logos, pictures or other intellectual property of musical groups or musical artists. For example, you cannot make merchandise depicting a musical group or artist simply because you run a fan-based website for that group or artist or just because you downloaded his/her/their image from an internet website. You also cannot modify the name of or other intellectual property relating to these individuals and avoid infringement.</li>
                    <li>NO use of names, logos, pictures, or other intellectual property of sports teams, colleges/universities, clubs, or organizations. Modifications may not avoid infringement.</li>
                    <li>NO photos, logos, caricatures, or other artwork depicting actors, actresses, models or other celebrities. Just because you take a photograph of a celebrity does not necessarily give you the right to use that photograph on merchandise, even if you digitally manipulate the photograph. However, Content depicting political figures is permissible if used to promote political free speech (and not to endorse products). A political figure is usually a person holding or seeking political office. While certain celebrities are sometimes active in politics, CafePress does not allow use of content depicting celebrities in any manner unless expressly authorized by that person.</li>
                    <li>NO use of trademarks, names, or logos of companies. For example, you cannot use the name of a company or company logo. However, Content depicting political parties is permissible if used to promote political free speech, and the Content does not otherwise use or depict other trademarks, names, or logos.</li>
                    <li>NO pictures or photographs of products (such as toys). Even if you own a product, intellectual property laws may still prohibit you from selling merchandise that features pictures of it. For example, you cannot take a picture of your famous doll and sell merchandise for that famous doll with that picture.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This list is NOT comprehensive. If in doubt, you should consult with an attorney.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class=&quot;bold underline&quot;>II. Marketing Restrictions</p>
        <ol type=&quot;A&quot;>
            <li><span class=&quot;bold&quot;>CafePress Branding Bar</span><br />You may not remove or alter the CafePress branding on your storefront and store pages.</li>
            <li>
                <span class=&quot;bold&quot;>False or Misleading Marketing Material</span>
                <p>You may not use false or misleading Content to market and promote your shops and products. Some examples of false and misleading information are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making claims that the proceeds from sales will go to a charity without first obtaining permission from such charity to use their name in connection with product sales, and complying with all applicable laws relating to charity fundraising;</li>
                    <li>Using a third party trademark to market your content (e.g. using &quot;Gucci&quot;® in your product descriptions, titles, tags or other SEO text on your CafePress shop); and</li>
                    <li>Spamming or attempting to deliberately subvert the results of the CafePress directory or search engine with false, misleading, or unnecessarily repetitive information (e.g., tag spamming or artificially increasing your CafePress search results rankings).</li>
                </ul>

(a) You may not use any existing or future software products or services that (1) will replace, intercept, interfere, hinder, disrupt or otherwise alter in any manner the Website user's access, view or usage of, or other aspect of the user's experience at any CafePress Affiliate Websites in a manner that causes or otherwise results in a different experience from what was otherwise intended by CafePress Affiliates; or (2) will block, alter, direct, redirect, substitute, insert, append itself to, or otherwise intercept or interfere in any manner with any click through or other traffic-based transaction that originated from CafePress Affiliates with the result of reducing any compensation or other payment earned by or owing to CafePress Affiliates. (b) You may not purchase, register, or bid on any keywords, search terms or other identifiers that include the term &quot;cafepress&quot; or variations thereof (for example &quot;cafepress&quot;, &quot;cafe press&quot;, &quot;CafePress.com&quot;, etc.) for use in any search engine, portal, sponsored advertising service or other search or referral service.</p>
                <p>If CafePress determines, in its sole discretion, that you have engaged in any of the foregoing activities, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to CafePress) withhold any referral fees otherwise payable to you under this Agreement and/or terminate this Agreement. (c ) If you are a CafePress Designer, you cannot earn commissions as an Affiliate by linking to your own CafePress Shops or Products. CafePress Designers can only earn commissions as an Affiliate by linking to the shops of other members or to the CafePress marketplace. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are abusing the system, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to us) withdraw your participation and withhold any commission fees payable to you through the Affiliate Program.</p>
                <p>3.3 Responsibility for Your Affiliate Website. You will be solely responsible for the development, operation, and maintenance of your Website and for all materials that appear on your Affiliate Website. For example, you will be solely responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The operation of your Affiliate website</li>
                    <li>Creating and posting any applicable Product descriptions on your Affiliate website and linking those descriptions to our catalog</li>
                    <li>The accuracy and appropriateness of materials posted on your Affiliate website</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that materials posted on your Affiliate website do not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third party</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that materials posted on your Affiliate website are not libelous or otherwise illegal</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class=&quot;bold underline&quot;>Customers Purchasing via the Program</span>
                <p>4.1 Order Processing and Reporting. We will process Product orders placed by customers who follow Special Links from your Affiliate Website to the Website (&quot;Customers&quot;). We reserve the right to reject orders that do not comply with any requirements that we may periodically establish. We will be responsible for all aspects of order processing and fulfillment. Among other things, we will prepare order forms; process payments, cancellations, and returns; and handle Customer service. We will track sales made to Customers who purchase products using Special Links from your Affiliate Website to the Website and will make available to you reports summarizing this sales activity. The form, content, and frequency of the reports may vary from time to time at our discretion.</p>
                <p>4.2 Policies and Pricing on the CafePress Website. Customers who buy products through this Program will be deemed to be our customers. Accordingly, all of our rules, policies, and operating procedures concerning customer orders, customer service, and product sales will apply to those Customers. We may change our rules, policies and operating procedures at any time. For example, we will determine the prices to be charged for any Products sold under this Program in accordance with our pricing policies. Product prices and availability may vary from time to time. Because price changes may affect products that you already have listed on your Affiliate Website, you may not include price information in your product descriptions. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to present accurate information, but we cannot guarantee the availability or price of any particular product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class=&quot;bold underline&quot;>Commissions</span>
                <p>5.1 Commission Fees. We will pay you fees on certain Product sales to third parties. For a Product sale to be eligible to earn a fee, the Customer must follow a Special Link from your Affiliate Website to the Website, select and purchase the Product using our automated ordering system within sixty (60) days of the initial Customer session on the Website, accept delivery of the Product at the shipping destination, and remit full payment to us. Only if all of the above circumstances are met will you be eligible for a fee to be paid. Products that are eligible for earning fees in the Affiliate Program may change at any time with no notice to Affiliates.</p>
                <p>5.2 Commission Fee Schedule. You will earn Affiliate commission fees based on &quot;Net Qualifying Revenues&quot; according to commission fee schedules established by us which as of today's date are as set forth below. &quot;Qualifying Revenues&quot; are base price revenues derived by us from our sale on our site of print-on-demand products such as apparel, prints or accessories. &quot;Net Qualifying Revenues&quot; do not include royalties, shipping &amp;amp; handling, gift-wrapping, taxes, and service charges. We pay monthly commissions of fifteen percent (15%) to Affiliates. Net Qualifying Revenues may only be generated in the Marketplace portion of the Website and no such revenues may be earned from the Shops portion of our site. Designers on the Website are not eligible for Affiliate commissions under this Affiliate Program. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are in violation of any rule of this Affiliate Program or of abusing the system in the manner as determined in our sole discretion, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to us) withdraw your participation and withhold any commission fees payable to you for Affiliate Websites you recruit.</p>
                <p>5.3 Commission Fee Payment. We will pay you commission fees on a monthly basis. Within sixty (60) days following the end of each calendar month, we will send you a check for the applicable commission fees earned on Net Qualifying Revenue generated during the applicable month, less any taxes on that Net Qualifying Revenue that we are required by law to withhold. However, if the commission fees payable to you for any month are less than $50, we will hold those commission fees until the total amount due is at least $50 or until this Agreement is terminated. If a Product that generated a commission fee is returned by the Customer, we will deduct the corresponding commission fee from your next monthly payment. If there is no subsequent payment, we will send you a bill for the commission fee.</p>
                <p>5.4 Processing Fees. If CafePress owes you accrued compensation that is less than $25 for at least 365 days, then we may send you payment of such accrued compensation minus a $10 processing fee. If the amount of accrued compensation is under $10 for at least 365 days, such amount will be used to cover our administrative costs and no payment will be made to you.</p>
                <p>5.5 Charitable Contribution. Unless we otherwise agree in writing, we may remit any payment otherwise due to you as a contribution in your name to a 501(c)(3) charitable nonprofit organization of our choice (or any charity agreed upon in writing by you and CafePress) if: you fail to provide us with accurate and complete contact information; and (ii) the funds remain outstanding for more than twelve (12) months. If we make such a contribution, our obligation to you shall be reduced by the amount of that contribution.</p>
                <p>5.6 Termination Fees. If you or we terminate your Affiliate Account, and you have less than $25 in accrued but unpaid compensation then outstanding, CafePress may charge you a $10 processing fee when sending you your final payment to cover its administrative costs.</p>

Any and all claims of infringement involving the Website, C&amp;B, and/or the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable federal law, and shall be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of California.

                <span class="bold uppercase">Please read this "dispute resolution by binding arbitration" provision carefully, because it requires you to arbitrate disputes with cafepress and it limits the manner in which you can seek relief.</span>
                <p class="uppercase">This provision precludes you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against cafepress. It also precludes you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, or representative action against cafepress by someone else. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or from having a jury trial. Whether to agree to arbitration is an important decision. It is your decision to make and you should not rely solely on the information provided in this agreement, as it is not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of arbitration. You should take reasonable steps to conduct further research and to consult with an attorney regarding the consequences of your decision. You may opt-out of this arbitration provision by following the instructions below.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Scope of Arbitration. </span>You and CafePress agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your access to or use of the Website, C&amp;B, or Services or to this Agreement or any other aspect of the parties’ relationship (a "Dispute"), shall be determined by arbitration, except that you and CafePress are NOT required to arbitrate any Dispute in which either party seeks equitable and/or legal or other relief for alleged violation of the Copyright Act, Lanham Act, or Patent Act or for state law claims of copyright, trademark, trade secret or unfair competition laws.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Small Claims Court. </span>Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Applicable Arbitration Rules and Procedure. </span>The arbitration shall be governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules”), available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in this Arbitration Provision, except that JAMS may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this Arbitration Provision, the rules set forth in this Arbitration Provision shall govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in Jefferson County, Kentucky.</p>

        <p>Our Content Usage Policy (CUP) establishes the guidelines for your use of the Website C&amp;B and/or the Services to upload, store and use your Content. Your use of the Website, C&amp;B and/or Services constitutes your agreement that everything you upload, store, or use on the Website complies with this CUP, and you accept liability for any non-compliant Content.</p>
        <p>If you believe that images on the Website or offered through the Services infringe your intellectual property rights, notify us at <a href="mailto:trademark@cafepress.com">trademark@cafepress.com</a>. If you are not a rightsholder, but believe that images on the Website violate this CUP, please email us at <a href="mailto:trademark@cafepress.com">trademark@cafepress.com</a>.</p>
        <p class="bold underline">I. Prohibited Images</p>
        <p>All Content uploaded to the Website will be evaluated against our CUP.</p>
        <p>Below are some general examples of prohibited Content. Although CafePress has the right and authority, in its sole and absolute discretion, to remove any Content on the Website which CafePress believes violates this CUP, you are always fully responsible for all Content that you upload to the Website.</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>
                <span class="bold">General Categories of Prohibited Content</span>
                <p>Content is prohibited on the Website if it:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>may infringe the intellectual property or other rights of a third party, including rights of privacy and personality;</li>
                    <li>makes inappropriate use of swastikas or other Nazi symbols and/or glamorizes the actions of Hitler or other individuals or groups advocating ethnic cleansing, genocide or similar activities;</li>
                    <li>uses symbols or marks signifying hate towards another group of people;</li>
                    <li>contains or consists of hateful and/or racist terms;</li>
                    <li>is pornographic;</li>
                    <li>nudity is prohibited on the Website;</li>
                    <li>exploits images of, or the likeness of, minors;</li>
                    <li>reveals the personal information of another person;</li>
                    <li>contains or consists of obscenities, vulgarities, and/or offensive remarks that harass, threaten, defame or abuse others such as F*** (Ethnic Group);</li>
                    <li>depicts violence, is obscene, abusive, fraudulent or threatening such as an image of a murder victim, morgue shots, promotion of suicide, etc.;</li>
                    <li>depicts or glamorizes the use of "hard core" illegal substances or drugs such as a person injecting a substance in their body;</li>
                    <li>is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable, generally offensive or in bad taste, as determined by CafePress; or</li>
                    <li>is otherwise prohibited by applicable law.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The list above is <span class="bold">NOT</span> exhaustive, and only serves as a general guideline.</p>
                <p>AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT TOLERANCE IN A DIVERSE WORLD: CafePress has millions of users, from varied backgrounds and cultures, who differ in their beliefs and views about what is considered acceptable and what is considered offensive. We recognize that along with such diversity comes differences which may result in some individuals being offended by the opinions, perspectives and creative expressions of others within our user group. We ask that you exercise tolerance, and respect each individual's right to express him- or herself in a manner consistent with our CUP.</p>
                <p>All Content that you upload is automatically stored to the Website. We do not review any Content before you upload it to the Website. By using our Services, you assume full responsibility for all of the Content that you upload to the Website, and for complying with our CUP.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Examples of Content Prohibited Under Intellectual Property Laws</span>
                <p>Following are some examples of Content that should not be uploaded to the Website under intellectual property laws:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NO unofficial merchandise, such as Content relating to professional sports teams, videogames, or Olympic merchandise.</li>
                    <li>NO use of names, logos, pictures or other intellectual property of musical groups or musical artists. For example, you cannot make merchandise depicting a musical group or artist simply because you run a fan-based website for that group or artist or just because you downloaded his/her/their image from an internet website. You also cannot modify the name of or other intellectual property relating to these individuals and avoid infringement.</li>
                    <li>NO use of names, logos, pictures, or other intellectual property of sports teams, colleges/universities, clubs, or organizations. Modifications may not avoid infringement.</li>
                    <li>NO photos, logos, caricatures, or other artwork depicting actors, actresses, models or other celebrities. Just because you take a photograph of a celebrity does not necessarily give you the right to use that photograph on merchandise, even if you digitally manipulate the photograph. However, Content depicting political figures is permissible if used to promote political free speech (and not to endorse products). A political figure is usually a person holding or seeking political office. While certain celebrities are sometimes active in politics, CafePress does not allow use of content depicting celebrities in any manner unless expressly authorized by that person.</li>
                    <li>NO use of trademarks, names, or logos of companies. For example, you cannot use the name of a company or company logo. However, Content depicting political parties is permissible if used to promote political free speech, and the Content does not otherwise use or depict other trademarks, names, or logos.</li>
                    <li>NO pictures or photographs of products (such as toys). Even if you own a product, intellectual property laws may still prohibit you from selling merchandise that features pictures of it. For example, you cannot take a picture of your famous doll and sell merchandise for that famous doll with that picture.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This list is NOT comprehensive. If in doubt, you should consult with an attorney.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bold underline">II. Marketing Restrictions</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li><span class="bold">CafePress Branding Bar</span><br>You may not remove or alter the CafePress branding on your storefront and store pages.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">False or Misleading Marketing Material</span>
                <p>You may not use false or misleading Content to market and promote your shops and products. Some examples of false and misleading information are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making claims that the proceeds from sales will go to a charity without first obtaining permission from such charity to use their name in connection with product sales, and complying with all applicable laws relating to charity fundraising;</li>
                    <li>Using a third party trademark to market your content (e.g. using "Gucci"® in your product descriptions, titles, tags or other SEO text on your CafePress shop); and</li>
                    <li>Spamming or attempting to deliberately subvert the results of the CafePress directory or search engine with false, misleading, or unnecessarily repetitive information (e.g., tag spamming or artificially increasing your CafePress search results rankings).</li>
                </ul>

All Affiliates that agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement are automatically approved and can begin participating in the program. At any time thereafter, CafePress may evaluate your status as an Affiliate and limit or terminate your Affiliate Account for any reason as determined in our sole discretion, including but not limited to, the inclusion of content that is in any way unlawful, harmful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, harassing, racially or ethnically derogatory or otherwise objectionable or damaging to our business. All decisions are final and in our sole discretion. If we revoke or terminate your Affiliate Account, you may reapply at any time, but there is no guarantee that any later determination will differ from the first. No coupon sites and no scripting are permitted in connection with any Affiliate Account.</p>
                <p>2.2 Contact Information. You must provide us with accurate and complete contact and payment information when you open an Affiliate Account. You must immediately notify us if any of your contact or payment information changes. If you do not provide us with complete, accurate, and updated contact information, you may not be eligible to receive commissions based on your participation in the Program. You will receive an email confirming your account information. If you do not provide full contact emails at registration, you will be contacted within thirty (30) days to update your information. If you fail to do so, your Affiliate Account will be subject to termination.</p>
                <p>2.3 Account Security. You will need to select a password if you open an Affiliate Account.

                <span class="bold underline">Your Affiliate Website</span>
                <p>3.1 The Use of Links from Your Affiliate Website. As a member of the Program, you may provide on your Affiliate Website one or more of the following types of links to the Website:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product Links</li>

                    <li>General Link to www.CafePress.com Home Page</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will provide you with guidelines and graphical artwork to use in linking to the Website. To permit accurate tracking, reporting, and commission fee calculation, we will provide you with special "tagged" link formats to be used in all links between your Affiliate Website and the Website. You must ensure that each of these links properly utilizes such special link formats. Links to the Website placed on your Affiliate Website pursuant to this Agreement and which properly utilize such special link formats are referred to as "Special Link(s)." You will only earn commission fees with respect to activity on the Website occurring directly through Special Links. We will not be liable to you with respect to any failure by you to use Special Links, including to the extent that such failure may result in any reduction of amounts which would otherwise be paid to you pursuant to this Agreement. You will, however, earn commission fees with respect to all product purchases through the Website once from that "Special" link.</p>
                <p>3.2 Additional Restrictions. (a) You may not use any existing or future software products or services that (1) will replace, intercept, interfere, hinder, disrupt or otherwise alter in any manner the Website user's access, view or usage of, or other aspect of the user's experience at any CafePress Affiliate Websites in a manner that causes or otherwise results in a different experience from what was otherwise intended by CafePress Affiliates; or (2) will block, alter, direct, redirect, substitute, insert, append itself to, or otherwise intercept or interfere in any manner with any click through or other traffic-based transaction that originated from CafePress Affiliates with the result of reducing any compensation or other payment earned by or owing to CafePress Affiliates. (b) You may not purchase, register, or bid on any keywords, search terms or other identifiers that include the term "cafepress" or variations thereof (for example "cafepress", "cafe press", "CafePress.com", etc.) for use in any search engine, portal, sponsored advertising service or other search or referral service.</p>
                <p>If CafePress determines, in its sole discretion, that you have engaged in any of the foregoing activities, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to CafePress) withhold any referral fees otherwise payable to you under this Agreement and/or terminate this Agreement. (c ) If you are a CafePress Designer, you cannot earn commissions as an Affiliate by linking to your own CafePress Shops or Products. CafePress Designers can only earn commissions as an Affiliate by linking to the shops of other members or to the CafePress marketplace. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are abusing the system, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to us) withdraw your participation and withhold any commission fees payable to you through the Affiliate Program.</p>
                <p>3.3 Responsibility for Your Affiliate Website. You will be solely responsible for the development, operation, and maintenance of your Website and for all materials that appear on your Affiliate Website. For example, you will be solely responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The operation of your Affiliate website</li>
                    <li>Creating and posting any applicable Product descriptions on your Affiliate website and linking those descriptions to our catalog</li>
                    <li>The accuracy and appropriateness of materials posted on your Affiliate website</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that materials posted on your Affiliate website do not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third party</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that materials posted on your Affiliate website are not libelous or otherwise illegal</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold underline">Customers Purchasing via the Program</span>
                <p>4.1 Order Processing and Reporting. We will process Product orders placed by customers who follow Special Links from your Affiliate Website to the Website ("Customers"). We reserve the right to reject orders that do not comply with any requirements that we may periodically establish. We will be responsible for all aspects of order processing and fulfillment. Among other things, we will prepare order forms; process payments, cancellations, and returns; and handle Customer service. We will track sales made to Customers who purchase products using Special Links from your Affiliate Website to the Website and will make available to you reports summarizing this sales activity. The form, content, and frequency of the reports may vary from time to time at our discretion.</p>
                <p>4.2 Policies and Pricing on the CafePress Website. Customers who buy products through this Program will be deemed to be our customers. Accordingly, all of our rules, policies, and operating procedures concerning customer orders, customer service, and product sales will apply to those Customers. We may change our rules, policies and operating procedures at any time. For example, we will determine the prices to be charged for any Products sold under this Program in accordance with our pricing policies. Product prices and availability may vary from time to time. Because price changes may affect products that you already have listed on your Affiliate Website, you may not include price information in your product descriptions. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to present accurate information, but we cannot guarantee the availability or price of any particular product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold underline">Commissions</span>
                <p>5.1 Commission Fees. We will pay you fees on certain Product sales to third parties. For a Product sale to be eligible to earn a fee, the Customer must follow a Special Link from your Affiliate Website to the Website, select and purchase the Product using our automated ordering system within sixty (60) days of the initial Customer session on the Website, accept delivery of the Product at the shipping destination, and remit full payment to us. Only if all of the above circumstances are met will you be eligible for a fee to be paid. Products that are eligible for earning fees in the Affiliate Program may change at any time with no notice to Affiliates.</p>
                <p>5.2 Commission Fee Schedule. You will earn Affiliate commission fees based on "Net Qualifying Revenues" according to commission fee schedules established by us which as of today's date are as set forth below. "Qualifying Revenues" are base price revenues derived by us from our sale on our site of print-on-demand products such as apparel, prints or accessories. "Net Qualifying Revenues" do not include royalties, shipping &amp; handling, gift-wrapping, taxes, and service charges. We pay monthly commissions of fifteen percent (15%) to Affiliates. Net Qualifying Revenues may only be generated in the Marketplace portion of the Website and no such revenues may be earned from the Shops portion of our site. Designers on the Website are not eligible for Affiliate commissions under this Affiliate Program. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are in violation of any rule of this Affiliate Program or of abusing the system in the manner as determined in our sole discretion, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to us) withdraw your participation and withhold any commission fees payable to you for Affiliate Websites you recruit.</p>
                <p>5.3 Commission Fee Payment. We will pay you commission fees on a monthly basis. Within sixty (60) days following the end of each calendar month, we will send you a check for the applicable commission fees earned on Net Qualifying Revenue generated during the applicable month, less any taxes on that Net Qualifying Revenue that we are required by law to withhold. However, if the commission fees payable to you for any month are less than $50, we will hold those commission fees until the total amount due is at least $50 or until this Agreement is terminated. If a Product that generated a commission fee is returned by the Customer, we will deduct the corresponding commission fee from your next monthly payment. If there is no subsequent payment, we will send you a bill for the commission fee.</p>
                <p>5.4 Processing Fees. If CafePress owes you accrued compensation that is less than $25 for at least 365 days, then we may send you payment of such accrued compensation minus a $10 processing fee. If the amount of accrued compensation is under $10 for at least 365 days, such amount will be used to cover our administrative costs and no payment will be made to you.</p>
                <p>5.5 Charitable Contribution. Unless we otherwise agree in writing, we may remit any payment otherwise due to you as a contribution in your name to a 501(c)(3) charitable nonprofit organization of our choice (or any charity agreed upon in writing by you and CafePress) if: you fail to provide us with accurate and complete contact information; and (ii) the funds remain outstanding for more than twelve (12) months. If we make such a contribution, our obligation to you shall be reduced by the amount of that contribution.</p>
                <p>5.6 Termination Fees. If you or we terminate your Affiliate Account, and you have less than $25 in accrued but unpaid compensation then outstanding, CafePress may charge you a $10 processing fee when sending you your final payment to cover its administrative costs.</p>

                <p>6.1 All other Communications. You may not make any press release with respect to this Agreement or your participation in the Program without our prior written consent, which may be given or withheld in our sole discretion. You may not misrepresent the nature of your or any other participant's participation in the Program, and doing so may result in suspension or termination from the Program.</p>
                <p>6.2 Other Website Promotion. If you engage in any of the prohibited activities noted below, you will be subject to immediate termination from the Program. a) Anti-Spamming Policy. You may not use "spam," "blast-faxes" or recorded telephone messages to market or sell Products. You may not spam or attempt to deliberately subvert the results of the CafePress directory or search engine with false, misleading, or unnecessarily repetitive information. b) Independence from CafePress. In all promotions, you must clearly represent yourself and your Website as entities independent from CafePress, our affiliated companies, the Website, and any of our affiliated companies' Websites, and you may not indicate in any way that we are "partners" or otherwise engaged in any business together other than the Program. In addition, you may not, in any manner, misrepresent or embellish the relationship between us, or express or imply any relationship or affiliation between CafePress and you or any other person or entity except as expressly permitted by this Agreement (including by expressing or implying that we support, sponsor, endorse or contribute money to any charity or other cause). c) General promotional guidelines and laws. We reserve the right at our sole discretion to modify the foregoing rules at any time.

If you choose to enable your Customers to use selected images from your Affiliate Website, either owned by you or licensed from a third party ("Images") to create and purchase Products, then you agree to abide by the following terms:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Prohibited Images: You may not design, manufacture, market or sell a Product that is generally offensive or inappropriate for use with the Program, as determined by CafePress in its sole and absolute discretion. Please refer to our Content Usage Policy for information about how CafePress exercises such discretion. For example, but without limitation, you may not design, manufacture, market or sell a Product that CafePress believes: infringes the rights of a third party, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and rights of privacy and publicity; (ii) is libelous, defamatory or slanderous; (iii) is obscene or pornographic; (iv) is designed to or does harass, threaten, or abuse others; or (v) violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation, including, without limitation, by exploiting images or the likeness of minors. While CafePress has no obligation to monitor the transactions or communications made through its Website, it reserves the right to cancel any such transaction or take any other action to restrict access to or the availability of any material that may be considered to be objectionable, without any liability to you or any third party.</li>
                    <li>Limited License to Your Images: In making available any Images for upload to and use on the Website in connection with the Program, you grant to CafePress a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, nonexclusive, right and license in such Images, in all media existing now or created in the future, to do what it deems reasonable: to permit you to use the Designer Service to design, manufacture, market and sell Products and (ii) to promote, market and advertise your Products, your Shop, or the CafePress Service generally. Without limitation, this promotion, marketing, or advertising may consist of: display of your Products, (ii) promotional "streams" of audio Images on the Website, and (iii) display of pages from book Products on the Website. CafePress. may sublicense the rights that you grant it in this Section to a third party subcontractor only for purposes of manufacturing Products sold through your Shop. This Section only gives CafePress the right to use your Images for the purposes stated above, and does not give CafePress ownership of any of your Images. Within thirty (30) days following termination of your Affiliate Account, CafePress will terminate its use of your Images.</li>
                    <li>Ownership of And Use Rights to Your Images: You must have all necessary approvals and consents necessary for the use of the Images, and you must deliver copies of those approvals and consents to CafePress if CafePress requests them. In all events, you, and not CafePress, will be responsible for the payment of all royalties or similar payments that are or may become due to any third party, such as all payments under licenses for third-party material in the Images, in connection with the use of Images under this Program.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold underline">Fraud</span>
                <p>Fraud; No Special Incentives. You may not participate in any scheme that would be deemed fraud, credit card fraud or an attempt to purchase Products from the Website with an intent to defraud, nor may you assist any third parties in doing so, whether successful in such efforts or not. You may not, directly or indirectly, offer any person or entity any consideration or incentive (including, without limitation, monetary payments or discounts) for using Special Links on your Affiliate Website to access the Website (e.g., by implementing any "rewards" program for persons or entities who use Special Links on your Affiliate Website to access the Website) for any reason, either to purchase Products, to become an Affiliate, or otherwise. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have offered any person or entity any such consideration or incentive, we may (without limiting any other rights or remedies available to us) withhold any commission fees otherwise payable to you under this Agreement and/or terminate this Agreement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold underline">Indemnification</span>

You also agree that covered claims under this indemnity obligation shall include (a) any claim that our use of any images provided via your Website infringes on any trademark, trade name, service mark, copyright, license, right of publicity, or other proprietary right of any third party, (b) any misrepresentation of a representation or warranty or breach of a covenant and agreement made by you herein, or (c) any claim related to your Affiliate Website, including, without limitation, content therein not attributable to CafePress.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold underline">Term and Termination</span>
                <p>10.1 Term. The "Term" of this Agreement will begin upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and your placement of our banner or textual link on your Affiliate Website and will end when terminated by either party.</p>
