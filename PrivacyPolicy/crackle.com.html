												<p>Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (<em>e.g.</em>, Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (<em>e.g.</em>, that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household).</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p id="inapp"><strong>In-App Tracking Methods</strong></p>	
								
												<p>There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.

					<p>SPE may share non-Personal Information, and Personal Information that is not deemed SPE-Collected PI hereunder (provided that SPE is aware of no restrictions on SPEâ€™s use, if any), with third parties or Sony Companies and their affiliates for any purpose.  SPEâ€™s sharing of SPE-Collected PI is, however, subject to the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><u>Marketing</u>:  While on the Service, you may have the opportunity to consent (which may be by opt-in or election not to opt-out) to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of SPE-Collected PI with a third party. Absent your consent (which may be by means of third party interaction described in the next bullet point), however, SPE will not share your SPE-Collected PI with third parties, other than Sony Companies, for their own direct marketing purposes, except in connection with Corporate Transactions (defined below).</li>
							<li><u>Your Disclosure or Consent</u>:  As more fully described in <a href="#section5">Section 5</a> (Information You Disclose Publicly or to Others) and <a href="#section6">Section 6</a> (Third-Party Services, Social Features, Advertising and Analytics), your activities on the Service may, by their nature, result in the sharing of your SPE-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal Information and your non-Personal Information) with third parties, and by engaging in these activities you consent to that and further sharing and disclosure to third parties.  Such third party data receipt and collection is subject to the privacy and business practices of that third party, not SPE.  </li>
						</ul>

					<p>SPE may also share any information about you (including, without limitation, SPE-Collected PI) for any purposes not inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, or otherwise not prohibited by applicable law, including, without limitation:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To SPEâ€™s agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers (collectively "<strong>Service Providers</strong>") who may receive, or be given access access to your information, including, without limitation, Personal Information, non-Personal Information, and Usage Information, in connection with their work on SPEâ€™s behalf, provided however, SPE does not authorize its Service Providers to use SPE-Collected PI provided by SPE to the Service Providers to send you direct marketing messages other than related to the Sony Companies absent your consent.  For more information on choices Service Providers may offer you click <a href="#choices">here</a>.</li> 
							<li>To comply with the law, law enforcement or other legal process, and in response to a government request; </li>
							<li>If SPE believes your actions are inconsistent with SPEâ€™s terms of use, user agreements, applicable terms or policies, or to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of SPE, the Service or its users, or any third party; and, </li>
							<li>SPE may share your SPE-Collected PI (as well as your other Personal Information and your non-Personal Information), in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of SPE assets, or transfer of all or a portion of SPEâ€™s business to another company ("<strong>Corporate Transactions</strong>").</li>
						</ul>

				<li><h5 id="sweepstakes">SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS, AND PROMOTIONS</li>
					<p>SPE may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a "<strong>Promotion</strong>"), including Promotions jointly sponsored or offered by third parties, which may require submitting Personal Information. If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including Personal Information, may be disclosed to SPE, co-sponsors, Service Providers, and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as required by law (<em>e.g.</em>, on a winners list). By entering, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may include consent to additional or differing data practices from those contained in this Privacy Policy.  Please review those rules carefully.</p>

				<p><a href="#overview">Return to navigation</a></p>

				<li><h5 id="section5">INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OR TO OTHERS</li>
					<p>The Service may permit you to post or submit UGC including, without limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including Personal Information.  If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the Service, your UGC will be considered "public" and will be accessible by anyone, including SPE.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Personal Information included in UGC is not subject to SPEâ€™s usage or sharing limitations, or other obligations, regarding SPE-Collected PI or other Personal Information under this Privacy Policy or otherwise, and may be used and shared by SPE and third parties to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law.  SPE encourages you to exercise caution when making decisions about what you disclose in such public areas. For more information on how UGC is treated under the Serviceâ€™s Terms of Use click <a href="/corp/tos.html#content-you-submit">here</a>.  California minors should see <a href="#childrens-privacy">Section 9</a> regarding potential removal of certain UGC they have posted on the Service.</p>

					<p>Additionally, the Service may offer you the option to send a communication to a friend. If so, SPE relies on you to only send to people that have given you permission to do so.  The friendâ€™s Personal Information you provide (<em>e.g.</em>, name, e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the communication, but not used by SPE for any other marketing purpose unless SPE obtains consent from that person.  Your contact information and message may be included in the communication.</p>  

				<p><a href="#overview">Return to navigation</a></p>


				<li><h5 id="section6">THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS</li>
					<p>The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Service (<em>e.g.</em>, apps and plug-ins), websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties ("<strong>Third-Party Service(s)</strong>". These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.  </p>

					<p>Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks ("<strong>Social Features</strong>").  Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a Third-Party Service; "liking" or "sharing" SPEâ€™s content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party Service account (<em>e.g.</em>, using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (<em>e.g.</em>, to pull or push information to or from the Service).  If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service (see <a href="#section5">Section 5</a>) or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Service (<em>e.g.</em>, by using a hashtag associated with SPE or other Sony Companies in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by SPE and Sony Companies.  Also, both SPE and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.</p> 

					<p>SPE may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising" ("<strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong>"), which may include sending you an ad on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., "retargeting").  </p>

					<p>SPE may use Service Providers for analytics services such as, without limitation, Google Analytics.  These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help SPE analyze Service users and how they use the Service.  Information generated by these services (<em>e.g.</em>, your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Serviceâ€™s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other internet usage.</p>  

					<p>Except to the extent SPE combines information from Service Providers, Third-Party Services, or other third parties with SPE-Collected PI, in which case SPE will treat the combined information as SPE-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy (see <a href="#section1C">Section 1(c)</a>), data obtained by SPE from a third party, even in association with the Service, is not subject to SPEâ€™s limitations regarding SPE-Collected PI under this Privacy Policy, however such data remains subject to any restrictions imposed on SPE by the third party, if any .  Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with SPE, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on Third-Party Services.  </p>

					<p>SPE is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.  See <a href="#choices">Section 11</a> for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising and analytics.</p>

				<p><a href="#overview">Return to navigation</a></p>

				<li><h5 id="data-security">DATA SECURITY AND MONITORING</li>
					<p>SPE takes reasonable measures to protect SPE-Collected PI (excluding UGC) from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet and online digital storage are not completely secure and SPE cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through the Service.</p>

					<p>To help protect you and others, SPE and its Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) monitor use of the Service, and may collect and use related information including SPE-Collected PI and other Personal Information  for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or seek prosecution for any potential threats to or misuse of the Service; ensure compliance with the <a href="/corp/tos.html" rel="external">Terms of Use</a> and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and otherwise to protect the rights and property of Sony Companies, their partners, and customers.  Monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through our Service.  If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the Service.</p>

				<p><a href="#overview">Return to navigation</a></p>

				<li><h5 id="international-transfer">INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</li>
					<p>SPE is based in the U.S. and the information SPE and its Service Providers collect is governed by U.S. law.  If you are accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the U.S.  Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Service or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the U.S. as set forth in this Privacy Policy. </p>

				<li><h5 id="childrens-privacy">CHILDRENâ€™S PRIVACY</li>
					<p>The Service is intended for a general audience and not directed to children less than 13 years of age.  Some portions of the Service, however, may be intended as appropriate for a mixed audience of users under and over 13 years of age, or for users under 13 years of age (<em>e.g.</em>, a separate "Kids" section).  For further information on how SPE treats Childrenâ€™s Personal Information (defined below) in connection with any childrenâ€™s or mixed-use portions of the Service (if any), please see the Childrenâ€™s Privacy Policy posted thereon, which will be deemed incorporated herein for purposes of that part of the Service.</p>

					<p>SPE does not intend to collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Childrenâ€™s Privacy Protection Act ("<strong>COPPA</strong>") ("<strong>Childrenâ€™s Personal Information</strong>") in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA, and for any childrenâ€™s or mixed-use portions of the Service (if any) SPE will comply with COPPA.  If you are a parent or guardian and believe SPE has collected Childrenâ€™s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact SPE <a href="https://secure.sonypictures.com/corp/contactus.html" rel="external">here</a> and SPE will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.  </p>

					<p>Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who have posted content or information on the Service, can request removal by contacting SPE <a href="https://secure.sonypictures.com/corp/contactus.html" rel="external">here</a>, detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it.  SPE will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that SPE does not control.</p>

				<li><h5 id="section10">ACCESSING AND CHANGING INFORMATION</li>
					<p>SPE may provide web pages or other mechanisms allowing you to delete, correct, or update some of the SPE-Collected PI, and potentially certain other information about you (<em>e.g.</em>, profile and account information).  SPE will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in SPEâ€™s then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or public postings from SPEâ€™s databases (California minors see <a href="#childrens-privacy">Section 9</a>) and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter.  Further, we reserve the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law. </p>

				<p class="indent5em"><strong>A.	Tracking Technologies Generally. </strong>
					<p>Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.  Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately.  Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobeâ€™s website <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html" rel="external">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html</a>.  Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.  </p>
		
					<p>App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (<em>e.g.</em>, most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app.  To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or device manufacturer.</p>

					<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many online services, SPE currently does not alter SPEâ€™s practices when SPE receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitorâ€™s browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit <a href="https://www.allaboutdnt.com" rel="external">https://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>, but SPE is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information.  Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. SPE is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of third party choice notices or choice mechanisms.   For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.</p>

				<p class="indent5em" id="section11B"><strong>B.	Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies.</strong>
					<p>You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" rel="external">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.  </p>
					
					<p>You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs.  Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Allianceâ€™s ("<strong>DAA</strong>") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" rel="external">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>, and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" rel="external">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a> for information on the DAAâ€™s opt-out program for mobile apps.  Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" rel="external">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>.  Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.  Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (<em>e.g.</em>, from other ad networks).  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use of a different device or web browsers or use a non-browser-based method of access (<em>e.g.</em>, mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  SPE supports the ad industryâ€™s 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (<a href="https://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf" rel="external">https://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf</a>). SPE is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-partiesâ€™ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.  </p>

				<p class="indent5em"><strong>C.	Mobile Apps.</strong>
					<p>With respect to SPEâ€™s mobile apps ("<strong>apps</strong>"), you can stop all collection of data generated by use of the app by uninstalling the app.  Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.  See also the prior section regarding the DAAâ€™s mobile Interest-based Advertising choices.</p>

				<p class="indent5em" id="section11D"><strong>D.	Communications.</strong>
					<p>You can opt out of receiving certain promotional communications (emails or text messaging) from SPE at any time by (i) for promotional e-mails, following the instructions provided in emails to click on the unsubscribe link, or if available by changing your communication preferences by logging onto your account; and (ii) for text messages, following the instructions provided in text messages from SPE to text the word, "STOP".  Please note that your opt-out is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions.  If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscription communications may continue.  Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional communications, SPE may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or SPEâ€™s ongoing business relations. </p> 
					
				<p class="indent5em" id="section11D"><strong>E.	Audience Measurement.</strong>

If you do not opt-in or if you opt-out at that time, SPE will not knowingly share the personal information that was collected in connection therewith with such identified non-affiliated third party(ies) for its/their own direct marketing purposes, but may continue to seek your consent to sharing with the same or other non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes from time-to-time.  Each consent notice and opportunity will be treated separately so it is possible that you may consent to some sharing but not to others.</p>
					
					<p>In addition, California residents may request information about SPEâ€™s compliance with the Shine the Light law and the Sony Companies with which SPE may have shared personal information for their direct marketing purposes by contacting SPE <a href="https://secure.sonypictures.com/corp/contactus.html" rel="external">here</a> or by sending a letter to Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. at 10202 W.
