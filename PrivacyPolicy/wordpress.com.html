				<h2>The gist:</h2>
<p>We (the <a href="http://automattic.com/about/">folks at Automattic</a>) run a blog and website hosting platform called <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> and would <strong>love</strong> for you to use it. WordPress.com&#8217;s basic service is free, and we offer paid upgrades for advanced features such as domain hosting and extra storage. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes on your website as possible and encourage you to express yourself freely. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appear on your website.</p>
<p>If you find a WordPress.com website that you believe violates these Terms of Service, please <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/disputes/">visit our dispute resolution &amp; reporting page</a>.</p>
<p>We also have additional services and products designed to make the web a better place like <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress.com VIP</a>, <a href="http://woocommerce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="http://longreads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Longreads</a>, <a href="https://vaultpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VaultPress</a>, <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, and <a href="http://jetpack.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jetpack</a>.</p>
<p>(We&#8217;ve made the below Terms of Service available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license, which means you&#8217;re more than welcome to repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and if you don&#8217;t mind we&#8217;d appreciate a link to WordPress.com somewhere on your website. We spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn&#8217;t need to do the same.)</p>
<h2>Terms of Service:</h2>
<p>The following terms and conditions (&#8220;Terms&#8221;) govern all use of the WordPress.com website and all content, services, and products available at or through the website, including, but not limited to, Jetpack (&#8220;Jetpack&#8221;), VaultPress (&#8220;VaultPress&#8221;), and WordPress.com VIP (“VIP Service”), (taken together, our &#8220;Services&#8221;). Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">Automattic’s Privacy Policy</a>) and procedures that may be published from time to time by Automattic (collectively, the “Agreement”). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and these Terms will apply to any upgrades. If you reside in the United States or Brazil, your agreement is with Automattic Inc. (US), and if you reside outside of the United States or Brazil, your agreement is with Aut O&#8217;Mattic Ltd. (Ireland) (each, “Automattic” or “we”).</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the Terms of this Agreement, then you may not access or use any of our Services. If these Terms are considered an offer by Automattic, acceptance is expressly limited to these Terms.</p>
<p>Our Services are not directed to children younger than 13, and access and use of our Services is only offered to users 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13 years old, please do not register to use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older.</p>
<p>Use of our Services requires a WordPress.com account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your password secure.</p>
<h3>1. WordPress.com.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your WordPress.com Account and Website.</strong> If you create a blog or website on WordPress.com, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and blog, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the blog. You must immediately notify Automattic of any unauthorized uses of your blog, your account, or any other breaches of security. Automattic will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibility of Contributors.</strong> If you operate a blog, comment on a blog, post material to WordPress.com, post links on WordPress.com, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using WordPress.com, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these Terms or the <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/user-guidelines/" rel="nofollow">User Guidelines</a>. By submitting Content to Automattic for inclusion on your website, you grant Automattic a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your blog. This license allows Automattic to make publicly-posted content available to third parties selected by Automattic (through the Automattic Firehose, for example) so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) your content through their services. You also give other WordPress.com users permission to share your Content on other WordPress.com websites and add their own Content to it (aka to reblog your Content), so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your website (the <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/reblogs">reblogging function</a> on WordPress.com does this automatically!). If you delete Content, Automattic will use reasonable efforts to remove it from WordPress.com, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Automattic has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Automattic’s sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or website&#8217;s URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in Automattic’s reasonable opinion, violates any Automattic policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of WordPress.com to any individual or entity for any reason. Automattic will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</li>
<li><strong>Web Traffic.</strong> We use a third party, comScore, Inc. (“comScore”), to measure WordPress.com’s audience and usage. By hosting your site on WordPress.com, you agree to assign the traffic relating to your website to Automattic and authorize us to sign a Traffic Assignment Letter on your behalf for comScore audience measurement reports. Your website’s traffic will be included under Automattic. You understand that your website will not receive credit for traffic in these reports, and you must not assign your website’s traffic to any other party. If we or comScore require additional documentation to verify ownership of your website or domain name, you agree to make reasonable efforts to accommodate such requests.</li>
<li><strong>Ecommerce. </strong>There are certain features on WordPress.com, such as Store and <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/simple-payments/">Simple Payments</a>, that enable you to sell items (goods, content, services, etc.) on your website. Store is powered by WooCommerce and Jetpack, so if you use Store, <a href="https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/">these additional terms</a> apply. You are solely responsible for all of your ecommerce activities, including your store, your items, its operation, all applicable taxes and fees,  compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and compliance with any applicable laws. Among other things, this means that:
<ul>
<li>You should use your best judgment when setting up your store, operating your store, processing payments, and selling items. For example, you may not want to accept check payments if you are not comfortable sharing your mailing address with a customer, or you may want to publish payment and return policies.</li>
<li>We are not involved in your relationships or transactions with any customer or potential customer.</li>
<li>You are responsible for resolving all support questions, comments, and complaints, including refunds, chargebacks, or pricing questions. You should provide contact information so that customers may contact you with questions or complaints.</li>
<li>You are responsible for delivering items sold to your customers, and for fulfilling all promises, representations, or warranties you make to them in connection with a sale.</li>
<li>You may choose to set up and/or use third party services, such as <a href="https://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a> or <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> to collect payment, or <a href="https://www.taxjar.com/">TaxJar</a> for tax calculations. If you do so, be aware that some of your — and your customers’ — data may be passed to the respective third party, and the respective third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, and other policies may apply. We are not involved in these relationships. If you use Store, please note that some of these third party services (like TaxJar) may be enabled by default, but you may disable them before your store is set up. If you do not want to use these third party services, please disable them in Store settings.</li>
<li>You are responsible for all taxes and fees associated with your ecommerce activities. You must collect, report, and/or pay the correct amounts to the appropriate authorities, if applicable, and if needed, inform your customers about any taxes they may be required to pay and issue appropriate invoices.
