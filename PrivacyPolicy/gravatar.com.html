		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	    			<p class="statement">Your privacy is critically important to us. At Automattic, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is Automattic Inc.’s privacy policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
<h3>Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h3>
<p>Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone–from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises–to build and manage a website to share with the world. Our mission is to democratize publishing. We believe in powering the open Internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the GPL. Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, vip.wordpress.com, jetpack.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, and akismet.com); </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mobile applications (including the WordPress mobile app for Android and iOS); and </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other products and services that are available on or through our websites (including WordPress.com plans, WordPress.com VIP, Jetpack, Gravatar, the IntenseDebate comment management system, and Akismet plans).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website, mobile applications and other products and services collectively as “Services.”</p>
<p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please <a href="mailto:privacypolicyupdates@automattic.com">contact us</a>.</p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>
<p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>
<h4><strong><i>Information You Provide to Us </i></strong></h4>
<p>It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Basic Account Information: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a </span><a href="http://www.wordpress.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> account to provide a username and email address–and that’s it. You may provide us with more information–like your name–but we don’t require that information to create your account. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Public Profile Information: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile. Your public profile is just that–public–so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Transaction and Billing Information:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you buy something from us–a subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, or a custom domain, for example–you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Content Information: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in the draft and published content for your website. For example, if you write a blog post that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet, if you choose to publish the post publicly. This might be obvious to you&#8230;but it’s not to everyone! </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Credentials: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password). For example, Jetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems on their site more quickly.<br />
</span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Communications with Us (Hi There!): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, or post a question about your site in our public forums. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b><i>Information We Collect Automatically </i></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also collect some information automatically: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Log Information: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.</span></b></li>
<li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site–in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted “[title of post]” at [time/date]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better. </span></li>
<li><b>Location Information: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (when, for example, you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions.</span></li>
<li><b>Stored Information: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile app. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions.  For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device&#8217;s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.</span></li>
<li><b>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and e-mails. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand e-mail campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see </span><a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/cookies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for information on WordPress.com and </span><a href="https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for information on Jetpack. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4><em><b>Information We Collect from Other Sources</b></em></h4>
<p>We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/publicize/">Publicize feature</a>, we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p>
<p>We may also get information from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users (…but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes.</p>
<h3>How We Use Information</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, or charge you for any of our paid Services;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further develop our Services–for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Automattic and others; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To communicate with you about offers and promotions offered by Automattic and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on Automattic and our products; and </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations and serve relevant advertisements.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Sharing Information</h3>
<h4><i>How We Share Information</i></h4>
<p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information.</p>
<p>We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Third Party Vendor</b><strong>s</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information) and those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers). We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>As Required by Law: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our </span><a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>To Protect Rights and Property: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Business Transfer</b><strong>s</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>With Your Consent:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to your site through our Publicize feature. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Aggregated and De-Identified Information: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Other Site Owners: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a WordPress.com account and leave a comment on a site that uses our Services (like a site created on WordPress.com or a site running Jetpack), your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Published Support Requests</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><i>Information Shared Publicly</i></h4>
<p>Information that you choose to make public is–you guessed it–disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your “likes” and comments on other websites that use our Services, are all available to others–and we hope you get a lot of views! We provide a “Firehose” stream of public data (like posts and comments) from sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content, but do not have rights to re-publish it, publicly. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/security/two-step-authentication/">Two Step Authentication</a>.</p>
<h3>Choices</h3>
<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Limit the Information that You Provide:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services–for example, paid, premium themes–may not be accessible. </span></b></li>
<li><b>Limit Access to Information On Your Mobile Device:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you do so, you may not be able to use certain features (like adding a location to a photograph, for example). </span></li>
<li><b>Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices. </span></b></li>
<li><strong>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, Automattic does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automattic’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automattic’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 25px;">Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)</h3>
<h4><i>Transferring Information</i></h4>
<p>Automattic is a worldwide service. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, which may have rights and protections that are different from those in your home country.</p>
<h4><i>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</i></h4>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by Automattic and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.</p>
<h4><i>Third Party Software</i></h4>
<p>If you’d like to use third party software like plugins with our Services, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself to those third parties. We don’t own or control these third parties and they have their own rules about collection, use and sharing of information. You should review their rules and policies when installing and using third party software.</p>
<h4><i>Our Users’ Websites</i></h4>
<p>If you are a visitor to one of our users’ websites–a self-hosted WordPress site that has installed Jetpack, for example–please note that this privacy policy doesn&#8217;t apply to you in regard to that specific site. We process information that visitors provide to our users’ websites on behalf of our users and in accordance with our user agreements. We encourage our users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information.</p>
<h4><i>One More Thing: This Policy Is Available Under a Creative Commons Sharealike License</i></h4>
<p>We’ve decided to make this privacy policy available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license. You’re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. Also, if you do use the policy we’d appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Automattic may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Automattic encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification through e-mail or your dashboard). If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of the Services after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your consent to such change.</p>
