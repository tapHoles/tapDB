Limitation of liability</h3> <h4 id=-a-name-free-use-a-11-1-free-use-of-our-services><a name=Free-use></a>11.1 Free use of our services</h4> <p>Our liability for use of the free services is restricted to intention and gross negligence or the absence of a guaranteed characteristic. We will be fully liable in cases of intention; in cases of gross negligence and the absence of a guaranteed feature, our liability will be restricted to typical and foreseeable damage. Any further liability is excluded.</p> <h4 id=-a-name-paid-use-a-11-2-use-of-the-contribution-of-services><a name=paid-use></a>11.2 Use of the contribution of Services</h4> <p>We will be liable as follows for use of all Services in connection with the contributions:</p> <p>(i) Claims for compensation on the part of the User are excluded from these Terms. Exceptions to this exclusion of liability are claims for compensation on the part of the Company for loss of life, bodily injuries, damage to health, the violation of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) or damages resulting from a deliberate or grossly negligent breach of duty on the part of Flattr, its legal representatives or agents. Cardinal obligations within the meaning of these Terms are the obligations that ensure the proper execution of the agreement and the fulfilment of its purpose and the observance of which the users can therefore regularly rely upon.<br>(ii) In case of a breach of fundamental contractual obligations, we are only liable for contract-typical, foreseeable damage caused by simple negligence, except claims made by Users for compensation resulting from loss of life, bodily injury or damage to health.

In place of the invalid, unenforceable term, the parties shall mutually agree on such valid commercial terms which the parties would reasonably have agreed otherwise. The above mentioned provision will apply correspondingly in the case of omissions in these provisions.</p> <p>October 12th, 2017</p> </div>
