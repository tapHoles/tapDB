				<h2 class="title">I. Data Collection and Use.</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="description">a. <em>Information You Directly and Voluntarily Provide to Us.</em> We may collect and store some or all of the following information you make available to us:</p>
					<ul>

If you download, register for or use the Service, we may ask you to provide your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, image, interests, demographic profile, credit card information, user name, password and other registration information. You may be required to register with us and provide us with the information we request from you in order to use the Service or to use some or all of the features offered by the Service. We may also offer you the option to complete a user profile that may be visible to other users of the Service. If a user profile feature is offered through the Service, you may be able to adjust the settings in your user account to specify the information in your user profile that will be shared publicly, that will only be shared with your friends, or that will remain private. If you are a registered user you may also be able to adjust your account settings through your user account. We note that, even if you adjust your settings so that your user profile is only shared with your friends or remains private, we will still be able to access and view the information you provide as part of your user profile.</li>
						<li>ii. Information you provide when you contact us for technical or customer support or with questions about your use of the Service.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="description">b. <em>Information Automatically Collected from You.</em> We collect any information you enter on the Service or give us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies depending upon how you use our Service. Our account registration process requires that you provide us with your user name, birthday and email address, and that you create and provide us with a password. We may also request other information such as your actual first and last name, gender, and zip code. In addition, you will have the opportunity to submit information about your personal medical and health condition to us through, for example, the ovulation calculator, symptom checker, BMI calculator, weight tracking and other tools available on the Site. That information may be associated with your profile and therefore become Personally Identifiable Information. You may access and update your personal information or account settings by logging onto your your profile tab on the Site and changing the information online.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>i. Device registration data (e.g., the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device or advertising ID, IP address, operating system and browser type)</li>
						<li>ii. Device settings (e.g., language preference)</li>
						<li>iii. Mobile carrier</li>

						<li>v. Requested and referring URLs</li>
						<li>vi. Location data collected through your device (including, for example, precise location data such as GPS and WiFi information)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="description">c. <em>Information You Publicly Post through the Service.</em> If you post information on public areas of the Service, such as reviews, comments or forums, that information may be collected and used by Leaf Group, other users of the Service, and the public generally. We strongly recommend that you do not post any information through the Service that allows strangers to identify or locate you or that you otherwise do not want to share with the public.</p>
					<p class="description">d. <em>How We Use the Information We Collect from You.</em> We and our service providers may use the information you provide or that is collected through the Service to operate and improve the Service, our other sites, applications, products and services, or to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, notices and marketing promotions relating to the Service. If you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by email, please follow the instructions contained in each email you receive from us describing how you can opt-out of receiving further marketing communications from us. If you are a registered user you may also be able to adjust your email settings by logging in to your account and adjusting your account settings.</p>

				<h2 class="title">II. Collection of Information by Third Parties.</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="description">a. <em>Advertising and Analytics.</em></p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Service may be supported through advertising, and we may work with third-party advertisers and advertising networks to provide advertising through the Service. We may provide these third-party advertisers and advertising networks with the ability to collect information about how you interact with the Service and, if applicable, your mobile device. This information may include the unique device or advertising identifier associated with your device and your precise location information, in order to help analyze and serve targeted advertising on the Service and elsewhere (including third-party sites and applications).</li>
						<li>We may also work with third party analytics companies to help us understand how the Service is being used, such as data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and website and mobile application analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. We may use Google Analytics, an analytics service provided by Google, Inc., or other third party analytics services providers (“Analytics Services”) to collect information about your use of the Service. These Analytics Services may collect information about the content you view and your system information and geographic information. The information generated by the Analytics Services about your use of the Service will be transmitted to and stored by the Analytics Services. The information collected by the Analytics Services allows us to analyze your use of the Service.</li>
						<li>We encourage you to review your device and Service settings to ensure they are consistent with your preferences, including with respect to the collection and use of information. You may be able to stop further collection of certain information by the Service by updating your applicable device settings, or you may uninstall the Service. In addition, you may choose not to share your location details by adjusting your mobile device’s location services settings. For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider/carrier or device manufacturer.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="description">b. <em>Third Party Links and Content.</em> In addition, the Service may include third-party advertising, links to third-party websites, and other content from third-party businesses. These third parties may use cookies, pixels and web beacons to track the actions of users online over time and across different websites or platforms in order to deliver targeted electronic advertisements to an individual user. For information about how tracking works for online advertising purposes you can visit <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">https://www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or <a href="https:///www.aboutads.info/appchoices">https:///www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>. We do not have access to or control over cookies, pixels or web beacons that third-party websites or partners may use. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party websites. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the different websites that you visit. In addition, some third-party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology. For more information about the opt-out process, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative website, available at: <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
																					<p class="description">c. <em>Do Not Track Requests.</em> If you access the Service through a browser, your browser may allow you to adjust your browser settings so that “do not track” requests are sent to the websites that you visit. However, we will not disable tracking technology that may be active on the Service in response to any “do not track” requests that we receive from your browser. You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and other similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require our consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered through the Service.</p>
					<p class="description">d. <em>Payment Processors.</em> If you make a purchase through the Service, you may be able to pay using a third-party payment service, such as Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, Amazon Pay or other third-party payment services. All information collected by these third-party payment services for purposes of processing your payments is not available to us, unless you have otherwise provided this information to us in connection with your use of the Service. Information collected from you by these third-party payment services is governed by the applicable third-party payment service’s privacy policy. You should review the applicable privacy policy prior to submitting any information to the applicable third-party payment service.</p>
					<p class="description">e. <em>Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests.</em> From time to time, we may host a promotion, sweepstakes, or content on the Service. You may be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer of your personal information to a third party in connection with such promotion, sweepstakes or content. The parties who privacy policy applies will be disclosed at point of collection or transfer and you will have a choice of whether or not you wish to permit such transfer or collection of information to a third party.</p>

				<h2 class="title">III. Social Media Services.</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>The Service may use social networking or “share functionality” or may contain links to third-party social media sites or applications that are not owned or controlled by Leaf Group. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you by these sites or applications, depending on the feature.  Leaf Group has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, any share functionality or the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party site or application. You are subject to the policies of those third parties when and where applicable. We also may allow you to use social media sites or applications to leverage your existing social media site or application accounts to access features of the Service.
